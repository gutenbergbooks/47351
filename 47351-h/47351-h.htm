<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">The</span> student of
European history is not surprised
to find that individuals stand out prominently
in every activity that occupied man's attention;
that even though there be under consideration great popular
movements, such as the Crusades or the Reformation
or French Revolution, attention centres around significant
personalities. In the day of monarchies and despotisms,
individual initiative very naturally led the way in outlining
policies, selecting lieutenants, finding ways and
means.</p>

<p>It is singular to what a great extent this is true in the
history of democratic America, preÃ«minently the land
where the people have ruled and where the usurper of
power has had, comparatively, no opportunity whatever.
And yet it is not too much to say that the history of our
nation may be suggested in a skeleton way by a mere list
of names, as, for instance, the history of the fourteenth
century in Europe might easily be sketched. While we
are proud to proclaim that America has given all men an
equal opportunity, that the most humble may rise to the
proudest position known among us, it yet remains singular

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
that in this land where the popular voice has ruled as
nowhere else almost every national movement or phase of
development may be signified by the name of one man.</p>

<p>This comes with appealing force to one who has attempted
to make a catalogue of the men who have in a
personal sense <i>led</i> the Star of Empire across this continent;
men who have, in a way, pooled issues with their country
in the mutual hope of personal advantage and national
advance. It then becomes plain to the investigator, if he
never realized it before, that, at times, the nation has
waited, even halted in its progress, for a single man, or
a set of men, to plan what may have seemed an entirely
selfish adventure and which yet has proved to be a great
national advantage. In certain instances there was a clear
and fair understanding between such promoters and the
reigning administration, looking toward mutual benefit.
At times the movement was in direct defiance of law and
order, with a resulting effect of immeasurable moment for
good. Again, there may have been no thought of national
welfare or extension; personal gain and success may have
been the only end; and the resultant may have been a
powerful national stimulus.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most remarkable feature that appears on
an examination of American history along these lines
(compared, for instance, with that of European powers)
is that comparatively few leaders of military campaigns
are to be classed among promoters who advanced national

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
ends in conjunction with personal ambitions. In the Old
World numberless provinces came into the possession of
military favorites after successful campaigns. In the many
expeditions to the westward of the Alleghanies in America
what commanders turned their attention later to the
regions subdued? Forbes, the conqueror of Fort Duquesne,
never saw the Ohio Valley again; Bouquet, the
other hero, with Gladwin, of Pontiac's Rebellion, never
returned to the Muskingum, nor did Gladwin come back to
Detroit; Lewis, the victor at Point Pleasant, led no colony
to the Ohio again; "Mad Anthony" Wayne never had
other than military interest in the beautiful Maumee Valley,
where, in the cyclone's path, he crushed the dream of a
powerful Indian confederacy lying on the flanks of the new
Republic. To a singular degree the leaders of the military
vanguard across the continent had really little to do personally
with the actual social movement that made the
wilderness blossom as the rose. True, bounty lands were
given to commanders and men in many instances, as in the
case of Washington and George Rogers Clark; but it was
the occupation of such tracts by the rank and file of the
armies that actually made for advancement and national
growth, and in perhaps only one case was the movement
appreciably accelerated by the course of action pursued in
a civil way by those who had been the leaders of a former
military expansion. How are we to explain the interesting
fact that none of the generals who led into the West the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
armies that won it for America are to be found at the
head, for instance, of the land companies that later attempted
to open the West to the flood-tide of immigration?
Did they know too well the herculean toils that such work
demanded? Why should General Rufus Putnam, General
Moses Cleaveland, General Benjamin Tupper, General
Samuel Holden Parsons, Colonel Abraham Whipple,&mdash;famous
leader of the night attack on the <i>Gaspee</i> in the
pre-Revolutionary days,&mdash;Judge John Cleve Symmes,
Colonel Richard Henderson, lead companies of men to
settle in the region which Andrew Lewis, Arthur St. Clair,
Joseph Harmar, Anthony Wayne, and William Henry
Harrison had learned so well? Of course more than one
reason, or one train of reasons, exist for these facts; but
it is not to be denied that those best acquainted with the
existing facts, those having the clearest knowledge of
the trials, dangers, and risks, both as regards health and
finances, were not in any degree prominent in the later
social movements. Many, of course, were soldiers by profession,
and itched not in the least for opportunity to
increase their possessions by investment and speculation
in a hazardous undertaking. But, had there been certain
assurance of success, these men, or some of them, would,
without doubt, have found ways and means of taking a
part. Had one attempt proven successful, an impetus
would have been given to other like speculations; yet one
will look in vain for a really profitable outcome to any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
undertaking described in these studies. The judgment of
those best posted, therefore, was fully justified.</p>

<p>But at the same time the American nation was greatly
in the debt of the men who made these poor investments;
and, in one way or another, it came about that no great
hardship resulted. This was no secret when these propositions
were under consideration, and the men interested
were influenced not a little by the fact that their adventure
would result in benefit to the cause of national advance.
There was a kind of patriotism then shown that is to be remembered
by all who care to think of the steps taken by
a weak, hopeful Republic; in some ways the same body
politic is still weak, and vastly in need of a patriotism not
less warm than that shown in those early days of wonderment
and anxiety.</p>

<p>The reader of the succeeding pages may conceive that
the author has not taken up each study in the same
method, and judged the performances of each so-called
"Pilot" by the same rule and standard. In the present
instance the writer has considered that such treatment
would be highly incongruous, there being almost nothing
in common between the various exploits here reviewed,
save only those that were incidental and adventitious.
Each chapter may seem an independent study, related to
that one following only through the general title that
covers them all; this, in the author's opinion, is better far
than to attempt to emphasize a likeness, or over-color
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
apparent resemblances, until each event may seem a natural
sequence from a former. A babe's steps are seldom alike;
one is long and inaccurate, another short and sure, with
many a misstep and tumble, and the whole a characterless
procedure bespeaking only weakness and lack both of
confidence and knowledge. Such, in a measure, was the
progress of young America in the early days of her national
existence.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">here</span>
is some
ground for the
objection that is
raised against
allowing the history
of America
to remain a mere
record of battles
and campaigns.
The sword had
its part to play,
a glorious part
and picturesque,
but the pioneer's axe chanted a truer tune than
ever musket crooned or sabre sang. And with
reference to the history of our Central West, for
instance, it were a gross impartiality to remember
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
the multicolored fascinating story of its preliminary
conquest to the exclusion of the marvellous
sequel&mdash;a great free people leaping into a wilderness
and compelling it, in one short century, to
blossom as the rose.</p>

<p>To any one who seriously considers the magic
awakening of that portion of the American Nation
dwelling between the Alleghanies and the Mississippi,
there must sooner or later come the
overpowering realization that the humble woodsman's
broadaxe&mdash;that famous "Brother of the
Sword"&mdash;has a story that is, after all, as fascinating
and romantic as any story ever told.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse">Lo, 'tis myself I sing,</div>
    <div class="verse">Feller of oak and ash!</div>
    <div class="verse">Brother am I to the Sword,</div>
    <div class="verse">Red-edged slayer of men!</div>
    <div class="verse">Side by side we have hewn</div>
    <div class="verse">Paths for the pioneer</div>
    <div class="verse">From sea to sun-smitten sea.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>It must be remembered that the sword made
many conquests in this West, while the broadaxe
made but one. France, and then England, possessed
the West, but could not hold it, for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
vital reason that this brother of the sword did
not march in unison with those armies. In fact,
both France and England attempted to keep the
axe-bearing, home-building people back in order
that the furs and the treasure yielded by the
forests might not be withheld. But when the
sword of a free people came across the Alleghanies
the axe of the pioneer came with it, and a miracle
was wrought in a century's time beside which the
Seven Wonders of the Old World must forever
seem commonplace.</p>

<p>Of the men who led this army of real conquerors
of the West to the scenes of their labors
there were many. Some were leaders because of
the inspiration they gave to others, some were
leaders because they in person showed the way,
enduring the toil, the privation, the pestilence,
and the fate of pioneers. In whatever class these
men may be placed, they were in reality patriots
and heroes, even though at the time they were
accused of seeking private gain and private fortune.
But through the perspective of the years
it seems clear that whatever may have been their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
private ends,&mdash;good, bad, or indifferent,&mdash;they
were extremely important factors in the progress
of their age. Whether seeking lands as a private
speculation, or founding land companies or transportation
companies in conjunction with others,
they turned a waiting people's genius in a new
direction and gave force and point to a social
movement that was of more than epoch-making
importance. Whether it was a Cleaveland founding
a Western Reserve on the Great Lakes, a
Henderson establishing a Transylvania in Kentucky,
a Putnam building a new New England
on the Ohio River, a Morris advocating an Erie
Canal, or an Astor founding an Astoria on the
Pacific Sea, the personal ambition and hope of
gain, so prominent at the time, does not now
stand preÃ«minent; in this day we see what the
efforts of these men meant to a country whose
destiny they almost seemed unwittingly to hold
in their hands.</p>

<p>It will ever be difficult to realize what a
critical moment it was when, for a brief space
of time, only Providence could tell whether the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
young American Republic was equal to the
tremendous task of proving that it could live
by growing. The wisest men who watched its
cradle wondered if that babe, seemingly of premature
birth, would live. But that was not
the vital question; the vital question was, Could
it grow? The infant Republic possessed a mere
strip of land on the seaboard; the unanswerable
argument of its enemies was that a weakling
of such insignificant proportions, surrounded by
the territories of England and Spain, could not
live unless it could do more than merely exist;
after winning (by default) a war for liberty, it
must now fight and win or lose a war of extermination.
And where were the millions of
money, the men, and the arms to come from
that should prevent final annihilation? The
long war had prostrated the people; the land
had been overrun with armies, farms despoiled,
trade ruined, cities turned into barracks, money
values utterly dissipated.</p>

<p>Just here it was that the mighty miracle was
wrought; a strange army began to rendezvous,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
and it was armed with that weapon which was
to make a conquest the sword could never
have made. It was the army of pioneers with
axes on their shoulders. So spontaneously did
it form and move away, so commonplace was
every humble detail of its organization and progress,
so quietly was its conquest made, so few
were its prophets and historians, that it has
taken a century for us to realize its wonder
and its marvel.</p>

<p>America here and now gave the one proof of
life&mdash;growth. Not from one point in particular,
but from every point, the ranks of this
humble army were filled; not one sect or
race gave those rough and shaggy regiments
their men, but every sect and every racial
stock.</p>

<p>That army had its leaders, though they wore
only the uncouth regimentals of the rank and
file. It is of certain of these Pilots of the Republic
that these pages treat,&mdash;men who were
moved by what were very generally called selfish
motives in their days. Yet against what human
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
motive may not the accusation of self-interest
be cast? It has been hurled against almost
every earnest man since Christ was crucified in
ignominy nineteen centuries ago. Scan the list
of men herein treated, and you will not find a
single promoter of the Central West who was
not accused of harboring an ulterior motive, if
not of downright perfidy. Some of the best of
these leaders of the expansion movement were
most bitterly maligned; the heroic missionaries
who forgot every consideration of health, comfort,
worldly prosperity, home, and friends were
sometimes decried as plotting ambassadors of
scheming knaves.</p>

<p>The pure and upright Washington, looking
westward with clearer eye and surer faith than
any of his generation, was besmirched by the
accusations of hypocritical self-aggrandizement.
Yet he must stand first and foremost in the
category of men who influenced and gave efficiency
to that vital westward movement. This
man, as will be shown, was more truly the
"Father of the West" than he ever was "Father
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
of his Country." A decade before the Revolution
was precipitated in sturdy Massachusetts,
he had become fascinated with the commercial
possibilities of the trans-Alleghany empire. He
explored the Ohio and Great Kanawha rivers,
and conceived what the future would bring forth;
he took up large tracts of lands. Before he died
he owned many patents to land in what is now
New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia,
Kentucky, Maryland, and Florida, as well as his
home farms along the Potomac. He had a
keen business sense, and demanded his full rights;
he forcibly ousted from his lands men who knowingly
usurped them; and all through the years
he was accused of using his preponderating influence
to further selfish plans; he was called a
land-shark and a robber. It is interesting to
know that his own private conclusion was that
his investments had not paid; his words were
that they had resulted more "in vexation than
profit." And when he spoke those words he was
master of between twenty and thirty thousand
of the most fertile acres in the Ohio River basin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet Washington had marvellously influenced
the nation's destiny by these "unprofitable" investments.
The very position he occupied and
which he was accused of misusing had powerfully
stimulated the army that was carrying the
broadaxe westward. In countless ways this man
had given circulation to ideas that were inspiring
and hopeful, and just so far as he believed he had
failed as a private speculator, he had in reality
triumphed mightily as the leading exponent of a
growing Republic which was called upon to
prove that it could grow.</p>

<p>Richard Henderson stands out prominently
as an honest leader of this army of conquerors.
We can never read without a thrill the sentence in
that letter of Daniel Boone's to Henderson in
which the bold woodsman pleads the necessity
of Henderson's hastening into Kentucky in 1775.
All that Kentucky was and all that it did during
the Revolution seems to have hung suspended
on the advance of Richard Henderson's party
through Cumberland Gap in that eventful April;
and those words of the guide and trail-blazer,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Boone, imploring that there be no delay, and
emphasizing the stimulating effect that Henderson's
advance would have on the various
parties of explorers, have a ring of destiny in
them. True, Virginia and North Carolina both
repudiated Henderson's Indian purchase, and the
promoter of historic Transylvania was decried
and defamed; but his advance into the valley
of the Kentucky gave an inspiration to the scattered
parties of vagrant prospectors that resulted
in making a permanent settlement in that key-stone
State of the West, which was of untold
advantage to the nation at large. And later
Virginia and North Carolina made good the loss
the founder of Transylvania had suffered because
of their earlier repudiation.</p>

<p>In Washington and Henderson we have two
important factors in the advance of the pioneer
army into the old Southwest&mdash;the region between
the Alleghanies and the Mississippi south
of the Ohio River.</p>

      alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Daniel Boone</span></div>
</div>

<p>Turning to the rich empire lying north of that
river, a chapter belongs to that resolute herald
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
of religious and social betterment, David Zeisberger,
who led his faithful Moravians from
Pennsylvania to found an ideal settlement in
central Ohio. The marvellous story of the indomitable
Catholic missionaries in America has
been receiving something of its share of attention
by the reading world, a story so noble and
inspiring that it is one of the precious heritages
of the past; that of the equally noble Protestant
missionaries in the Middle and Far West has
not yet received its due. The Moravian Brethren
received the first acre of land ever legally
owned by white men in Ohio. Here, in "the
Meadow of Light" on the Tuscarawas River,
Zeisberger and his noble comrade, John Heckewelder,
attempted to found a civilized colony
of Christian Indians. But for the Revolution,
he would doubtless have succeeded. The story
of his temporary success is of great romantic
interest and of moment especially by way of
comparison. A legal right to land was secured
by this migrating colony of Indians under the
leadership of white missionaries; it was to be, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
all intents and purposes, a white man's settlement,
and agriculture was to be the colony's
means of support. Laws and rules of conduct
were formulated, and for five interesting years
a great degree of success attended the effort.
Then came war, despoliation, and a thrilling
period of wandering. But never was the fact
of legal ownership ignored; when the United
States first enacted laws for the disposal of land in
the Northwest Territory it excepted the district
"formerly" allotted to the Moravian Brethren.</p>

<p>Again, the history of the Middle West contains
no sturdier or sweeter character than Rufus
Putnam, the head of the Ohio Company of
Associates who made the first settlement in the
Northwest Territory at Marietta. As evidence
of what he was in time of danger, his long
record in the old French War, the Revolution,
and the Indian War in the West is open to all
men; what he was in days of peace&mdash;how he
was the mainstay of his fellow officers in their
attempt to obtain their dues from Congress,
how he cheered westward that little company
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
which he led in person, how for two decades he
was the unselfish friend of hundreds of this
struggling army of pioneers&mdash;is a story great
and noble. As we shall see, General Washington,
in a secret document never intended for
other eyes than his own, describes Putnam as
little known outside of a definite circle of friends.
If this militated against his being appointed
commander-in-chief of the American armies
(for which honor General "Mad" Anthony
Wayne was named), it made the man the more
beloved and helpful. Not seeking in convivial
ways the friendship of the notables of his time,
Rufus Putnam went about the commonplace
affairs of his conscientious life, doing good; yet in
the most critical hour in the history of the Northwest
it was to Putnam that Washington turned
in confidence and hope. In the formation of the
Ohio Company, in the emigration from New
England, in the hard experiences of hewing out
homes and clearings on the Ohio, and in the
humble, wearing vicissitudes of life on the
tumultuous frontier, the resolution, tact, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
patient charity of this plain hero made him one of
the great men in the annals of our western land.</p>

<p>This Ohio Company of Associates made the first
settlement in the territory northwest of the River
Ohio, from which were created the five great
States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and
Wisconsin. In the actual peopling of that region
no one man, perhaps, exerted the influence of
Rufus Putnam; and though, as a company, the
Associates never were able to keep their contract
with the Government, the great value of the
movement led by Putnam was recognized, as
Virginia and North Carolina recognized Henderson's
influence to the southward, and Congress
agreed to an easy settlement.</p>

<p>The empire of the Ohio Basin being thrown
open to the world by the armies of pioneers inspired
by Washington and led by such men as
Henderson and Putnam, a great factor in its
occupation were the men who succeeded Washington
in carrying out his plan for opening avenues
of immigration. Three great routes to the West,
and their projectors, call for notice in this phase
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
of our study. The rise of Henry Clay's famous
National Road running from Cumberland, Maryland,
almost to St. Louis was a potent factor
in the awakening of the West. It was the one
great American highway; it took millions of men
and wealth into the West, and, more than any
material object, "served to cement and save the
Union." Three canals were factors in this great
social movement, especially the Erie Canal, which
was conceived by the inspiration of Morris and
achieved by the patient genius of Clinton. As
a promoter of the West, Thomas, father of our
first railway, must be accounted of utmost importance.
Is it not of interest that the famed
Cumberland Road was not built to connect two
large Eastern cities, or a seaport or river with a
city? It was built from the East into the Western
wilderness&mdash;from a town but little known
to an indefinite destination where the towns were
hardly yet named. Its promoters were men of
faith in the West, hopeful of its prosperity and
anxious as to its loyalty. Now the same was
singularly true of our first three great canals, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Erie, the Chesapeake and Ohio, and the Pennsylvania.
These were not built as avenues of commerce
between great Eastern cities, but rather
from the East to the awakening West, to the
infant hamlets of Buffalo and Pittsburg. And,
still more remarkable, our first railways were not
laid out between large Eastern cities, but from
the East into that same country of the setting
sun where the forests were still spreading and
little villages were here and there springing up.
The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was distinctly
promoted in the hope that Baltimore might retain
the trade of the West which the canals then
building seemed to be likely to take from her.
It was their faith in the West that inspired all
these men to the tasks they severally conceived
and enthusiastically completed. It would hardly
be possible to emphasize sufficiently the part
played in the history of early America by this
supremely momentous intuition of the westward
advance of the Republic, the divine logic of that
advance, and its immeasurable consequences.</p>

story of
personal endeavor
that had
a part in building
up a new
nation on this
continent can
appeal more
strongly to us
of the Middle
West than that
of George
Washington's
shrewd faith which led him first to invest heavily
in Western lands and signally champion that region
as a field for exploitation? Indeed the record
of that man's prescience in realizing what the West
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
would become, how it would be quickly populated,
and how rapidly its acres would increase in value,
is one of the most remarkable single facts in his
history.</p>

<p>It is only because Washington became well
known to a continent and a world as the leader
of a people to freedom, that it has been easy to
forget what a great man he still would have
been had there been no Revolution and no Independence
Day. How well known, for instance,
is it that Washington was surveying lands on
the Great Kanawha and Ohio rivers only four
years before he received that remarkable ovation
on his way to take command of the Continental
Army under the Cambridge Elm? And how
much attention has been given to Washington's
tour into the Ohio Basin the very next year after
the Revolutionary War to attempt to mark out
a commercial route between the Virginia tide-water
rivers and the Great Lakes by way of the
Ohio and its tributaries? Yet the diary of that
trip is not only the longest single literary production
we have in our first President's handwriting,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
but on examination it is found to be
almost a State paper, pointing out with wonderful
sagacity the line of national expansion and
hinting more plainly than any other document,
not excepting the famous Ordinance, of the greatness
of the Republic that was to be.</p>

<p>Washington was possibly the richest man in
America, and half his wealth lay west of the Alleghanies;
it has not seemed to be easy to remember
that this statesman had a better knowledge of the
West than any man of equal position and that he
spent a large portion of his ripest years in planning
minutely for the commercial development
of a territory then far less known to the common
people of the country than Alaska is to us of to-day.</p>

<p>To few men's private affairs has a nation had
more open access than we have had to George
Washington's. His journals, diaries, letters,
and memoranda have been published broadcast,
and the curious may learn, if they choose, the
number of kerchiefs the young surveyor sent to
his washerwoman long before his name was
known outside his own county, or what the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
butter bill was for a given month at the Executive
Mansion during the administration of our
first President. Many men noted for their
strength of personality and their patriotism have
suffered some loss of character when their private
affairs have been subjected to a rigid examination.
Not so with Washington. It is a current legend
in the neighborhood where he resided that he
was exceedingly close-handed. This is not borne
out in a study of his land speculations. Here is
one of the interesting phases of the story of his
business life, his generosity and his thoughtfulness
for the poor who crowded upon his far-away
choice lands. Beyond this the study is of
importance because it touches the most romantic
phase of Western history, the mad struggle of
those who participated in that great burst of
immigration across the Alleghanies just before
and just after the Revolutionary War.</p>

<p>The hand of Providence cannot be more
clearly seen in any human life than in Washington's
when he was turned from the sea and sent
into the Alleghanies to survey on the south
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
branch of the Potomac for Lord Fairfax, in 1748;
it seemed unimportant, perhaps, at the moment
whether the youth should follow his brother
under Admiral Vernon or plunge into the forests
along the Potomac. But had his mother's wish
not been obeyed our West would have lost a
champion among a thousand. As it was, Washington,
in the last two years of the first half
of the eighteenth century, began to study the
forests, the mountains, and the rivers in the rear
of the colonies. The mighty silences thrilled
the young heart, the vastness of the stretching
wilderness made him sober and thoughtful. He
came in touch with great problems at an early
and impressionable age, and they became at once
life-problems with him. The perils and hardships
of frontier life, the perplexing questions of
lines and boundaries, of tomahawk and squatter
claims, the woodland arts that are now more than
lost, the ways and means of life and travel in the
borderland, the customs of the Indians and their
conceptions of right and wrong, all these and
more were the problems this tall boy was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
fortunately made to face as the first step toward
a life of unparalleled activity and sacrifice.</p>

<p>The influence of Lord Fairfax, whom he served
faithfully, now soon brought about Washington's
appointment as one of four adjutant-generals of
Virginia. In rapid order he pushed to the front.
In 1753 his governor sent him on the memorable
journey to the French forts near Lake Erie, and
in the following year he led the Virginia regiment
and fought and lost the Fort Necessity campaign.
The next year he marched with Braddock
to the "Bloody Ford" of the Monongahela.
For three years after this terrible defeat Washington
was busy defending the Virginia frontier,
and in 1758 he went to the final conquest of
Fort Duquesne with the dying but victorious
Forbes.</p>

<p>Having married Martha Custis, the young
colonel now settled down at Mount Vernon, and
his diary of 1760 shows how closely he applied
himself to the management of his splendid estate.
But the forests in and beyond the Alleghanies,
which he had visited on five occasions before he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
was twenty-six years of age, were closely identified
with his plans, and it is not surprising that as
early as 1767 we find the young man writing a
hasty letter concerning Western investments to
William Crawford, a comrade-in-arms in the campaign
of 1758, who lived near the spot where
Braddock's old road crossed the Youghiogheny
River.</p>

<p>From this letter, written September 21, 1767,
it is clear that Washington had determined to
make heavy investments. "My plan is to secure
a good deal of land," he wrote. He desired land
in Pennsylvania as near Pittsburg as possible;
if the law did not allow one man to take up
several thousand acres, Crawford was requested
to make more than one entry, the total to
aggregate the desired amount. As to quality,
Washington was to the point.</p>

<p class="bq">"It will be easy for you to conceive that ordinary or
even middling lands would never answer my purpose or
expectation; ... a tract to please me must be rich ...
and, if possible, level."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>As to location, he was not concerned:</p>

<p class="bq">"For my own part, I should have no objection to a
grant of land upon the Ohio, a good way below Pittsburg,
but would first willingly secure some valuable tracts nearer
at hand."</p>

<p>Washington correctly estimated the purpose
and effectiveness of the King's proclamation of
1763. This proclamation, at the close of Pontiac's
rebellion, declared that no land should be
settled beyond the heads of the Atlantic waters.
In the same letter he said:</p>

<p class="bq">"I can never look upon that proclamation in any other
light (but I say this between ourselves) than as a temporary
expedient to quiet the minds of the Indians....
Any person, therefore, who neglects the present opportunity
of hunting out good lands, and in some measure marking
and distinguishing them for his own, in order to keep
others from settling them, will never regain it."</p>

<p>Washington was first and foremost in the field
and intended to make the most of his opportunities.
He wrote:</p>

<p class="bq">"If the scheme I am now proposing to you were known,
it might give alarm to others, and by putting them upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
a plan of the same nature, before we could lay a proper
foundation for success ourselves, set the different interests
clashing, and, probably, in the end overturn the whole.
All this may be avoided by a silent management, and the
operation carried on by you under the guise of hunting
game."</p>

<p>Crawford accordingly took tracts for Washington
near his own lands on the Youghiogheny,
costing "from a halfpenny to a penny an acre."</p>

<p>Note that at this early day (1767), almost all
the land between the Youghiogheny and Monongahela
rivers&mdash;the country through which
Braddock's Road ran&mdash;was already taken up.
A large tract on Chartier's Creek was secured
by Crawford for his friend. Within five years
Washington had come into the additional possession
of the historic tract of two hundred and
thirty-seven acres known as Great Meadows,&mdash;whereon
he had fought his first battle and signed
the first and only capitulation of his life,&mdash;and
the splendid river-lands known to-day as "Washington's
Bottoms," on the Ohio near Wheeling
and Parkersburg, West Virginia, and below.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
It is a very interesting fact that Washington
did not belong to any of the great land companies
which, one after another, sought to gain
and hold great tracts of land, except the Mississippi
Company which did not materialize. His
brothers were members of the Ohio Company
which in 1749 secured a grant of two hundred
thousand acres between the Monongahela and
Kanawha rivers. The company was never able
to people and hold its territory, and the proprietors
each lost heavily. It is a little strange
that Washington had nothing to do with Walpole's
Grant, the Transylvania Company, or the
later Ohio, Scioto, and Symmes companies.</p>

<p>What might be considered an exception to
this rule was the body of men (among whom
Washington was a generous, fearless leader)
which sought to secure for the Virginia soldiers
of the Fort Necessity campaign the bounty-land
promised them by Governor Dinwiddie in 1754.
Year after year, for twenty years, Washington
was continually besieged by the soldiers he led
West in 1754 or their relatives, who implored
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
his aid in securing the grant of land promised,
and there is no more interesting phase of his life
during these years than his patient persistence in
compelling Virginia to make good her solemn
pledge. To impatient and impertinent men
such as Colonel Mercer he wrote scathing rebukes;
to helpless widows and aged veterans
he sent kind messages of hope and cheer.</p>

<p>The trouble was that everybody was claiming
the land beyond the Alleghanies; the Ohio Company
was fighting for its rights until the London
agent questionably formed a merger with the
Walpole Grant speculators. This company had
claimed all the land between the Monongahela
and the Kanawha. Washington, accordingly,
had attempted to secure the two hundred thousand
acres for his Fort Necessity comrades on
the western shore of the Kanawha. In 1770 he
made his sixth western journey in order to view
his own purchases and make a beginning in the
business of securing the soldiers' lands. He
left Mount Vernon October 5 and reached
William Crawford's, on the Youghiogheny, on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
the thirteenth. On the sixteenth Washington
visited his sixteen-hundred acre tract near by
and was pleased with it. On the third of
November he blazed four trees on the Ohio,
near the mouth of the Great Kanawha. He
wrote:</p>

<p class="bq">"At the beginning of the bottom above the junction of
the rivers, and at the mouth of a branch on the east side,
I marked two maples, an elm, and hoop-wood tree, as a
corner of the soldiers' land (if we can get it), intending to
take all the bottom from hence to the rapids in the Great
Bend into one survey. I also marked at the mouth of
another run lower down on the west side, at the lower end
of the long bottom, an ash and hoop-wood for the beginning
of another of the soldiers' surveys, to extend up
so as to include all the bottom in a body on the west
side."</p>

<p>From this time on Crawford was busy surveying
for Washington, either privately or in behalf
of the soldiers' lands, until the outbreak of
Dunmore's War in 1774. For these bounty-land
surveys, Washington was particularly attentive,
writing Crawford frequently "in behalf of
the whole officers and soldiers, and beg of you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
to be attentive to it, as I think our interest is
deeply concerned in the event of your dispatch."</p>

<p>When Walpole's Grant was confirmed by King
George, Washington greatly feared the loss of
the lands promised to himself and his comrades
of 1754. His own share was five thousand acres,
and he had purchased an equal amount from
others who, becoming hopeless, offered their
claims for sale. This grant was bounded on the
west by the old war-path which ran from the
mouth of the Scioto River to Cumberland Gap.
Accordingly, in September, 1773, Washington
wrote Crawford to go down the Ohio below the
Scioto. Washington did not know then that the
purchasers of Walpole's Grant had agreed to set
apart two hundred thousand acres for the heroes
of 1754. It is significant that he was particular
to avoid all occasion for conflicting claims; he
originally wanted the soldiers' surveys to be
made beyond the Ohio Company's Grant; later
beyond the Walpole Grant. And while war and
other causes put a disastrous end to the work of
the promoters of all the various land companies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
with which Washington had nothing to do, the
soldiers' lands were saved to them, and all received
their shares. Washington also retained
his private lands surveyed by Crawford, and
owned most of them in 1799, when he died. In
1784, Washington had patents for thirty thousand
acres and surveys for ten thousand more.
Briefly, his possessions may be described as ten
thousand acres on the south bank of the Ohio
between Wheeling and Point Pleasant, West
Virginia, and twenty thousand acres in the
Great Kanawha Valley, beginning three miles
above its mouth, "on the right and left of the
river, and bounded thereby forty-eight miles and
a half."</p>

<p>Washington's ethics and his enterprise with
reference to his Western speculations were both
admirable, but we can only hint of them here.
He was strict with himself and with others, but
he knew how to be lenient when leniency would
not harm the recipient. To his later agent,
Thomas Freeman (Crawford was captured and
put to death by the Indians in 1782), he wrote
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
in 1785: "Where acts of Providence interfere to
disable a tenant, I would be lenient in the exaction
of rent, but when the cases are otherwise,
I will not be put off; because it is on these my
own expenditures depend, and because an accumulation
of undischarged rents is a real injury
to the tenant." While his agents were ordered
to use all legal precautions against allowing his
lands to be usurped by others, Washington was
particular that needy people, stopping temporarily,
should not be driven off; and he was exceedingly
anxious from first to last that no
lands should be taken up for him that were anywise
claimed by others. It is a fact that Washington
had few disputes in a day when disputes
over lands and boundaries were as common as
sunrise and sunset. No landholder in the West
had so little trouble in proportion to the amount
of land owned.</p>

<p>The intensity of Washington's business energy
is not shown more plainly than by his enterprise
in finding and exploiting novelties. One day
he was studying the question of rotation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
crops; the next found him laboring all day with
his blacksmith fashioning a newfangled plough.
The next day he spent, perhaps, in studying a
plan of a new machine invented in Europe to haul
trees bodily out of the ground, an invention
which meant something to a man who owned
thirty thousand acres of primeval forest. He
ordered his London agent to send on one of
these machines regardless of cost, if they were
really able to do the feats claimed. Again he
was writing Tilghman at Philadelphia concerning
the possibility and advisability of importing
palatines from Europe, with which to settle his
Western farms. Now he was examining veins of
coal along the Youghiogheny and experimenting
with it, or studying the location of salt-springs
and the manufacture of salt, which in the West
was twice dearer than flour. A whole essay could
be devoted to Washington's interest in mineral
springs at Saratoga, Rome, New York, and in
the West, and to his plan outlined to the president
of the Continental Congress to have the
United States retain possession of all lands lying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
immediately about them. We do not know who
built the first grist-mill west of the Alleghanies,
but it is doubtful if there was another save
Washington's at Perryopolis, Fayette County,
Pennsylvania, before the Revolutionary War.
"I assure you," wrote Crawford, "it is the best
mill I ever saw anywhere, although I think one
of a less value would have done as well." It is
the boast of Ohioans that the millstones for the
first mill in the old Northwest were "packed"
over the mountains from Connecticut. Washington
might have boasted, a score of years
earlier, that he had found his millstones right in
the Alleghanies, and they were "equal to English
burr," according to his millwright. The mill
which is still in operation on Washington's Run
is on the original site of the one built by him in
1775. Portions of the original structure remain
in the present mill, and it is known far and wide
by the old name. The water-power, which is no
longer relied upon except during wet seasons,
still follows the same mill-race used in Revolutionary
days, and the reconstructed dam is on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
the old site. The improvements on Washington's
plantation here, overseer's house, slave
quarters, etc., were situated near Plant No. 2 of
the Washington Coal and Coke Company. It is
known that Washington became interested in the
coal outcropping here, but it is safe to say that
he little dreamed that the land he purchased
with that lying contiguous to it would within
a century be valued at twenty million dollars.
In view of the enormous value of this territory,
it is exceedingly interesting to know that Washington
was its first owner, and that he found
coal there nearly a century and a half ago.</p>

<p>In 1784 Washington issued a circular offering
his Western lands to rent:</p>

<p class="bq">"These lands may be had on three tenures: First, until
January, 1790, and no longer. Second, until January,
1795, renewable every ten years for ever. Third, for nine
hundred and ninety-nine years."</p>

<p>The conditions included clearing five new
acres every year for each hundred leased and
the erection of buildings within the time of lease.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
The staple commodity was to be medium of
exchange. The seventh condition is interesting:</p>

<p class="bq">"These conditions &amp;c. being common to the leases of
three different tenures, the rent of the first, will be Four
Pounds per annum, for every hundred acres contained in
the lease, and proportionably for a greater or lesser quantity;
of the second, One Shilling for every acre contained
in the lease until the year 1795, One Shilling and Sixpence
for the like quantity afterwards till the year 1815,
and the like increase per acre for every ten years, until
the rent amounts to and shall have remained at Five
Shillings for the ten years next ensuing, after which it is
to increase Threepence per acre every ten years for ever;
of the Third, Two Shillings for every acre therein contained,
at which it will stand for nine hundred and ninety-nine
years, the term for which it is granted."</p>

<p>Five years before his death Washington resolved
to dispose of his Western lands. The
investments had not been so profitable as he had
hoped. As early as June 16, 1794, he wrote
Presley Neville:</p>

<p class="bq">"From the experience of many years, I have found
distant property in land more pregnant of perplexities
than profit. I have therefore resolved to sell all I hold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
on the Western waters, if I can obtain the prices which I
conceive their quality, their situation, and other advantages
would authorize me to expect."</p>

<p>A circular advertising his Western lands was
issued in Philadelphia, dated February 1, 1796.
It described 32,317 acres in Pennsylvania, Virginia,
and Kentucky for sale; the terms were
one-fourth payment down, and the remainder to
be paid in five years with interest "annually and
punctually paid."</p>

<p>With this story of Washington's acquaintance
with the West and his speculations there in
mind, it is now possible to take up, knowingly,
the great result to which they led&mdash;the first
grand plan of American internal improvements,
of which Washington was the father.</p>

<p>As early as 1754, Washington, then just come
of age, made a detailed study of the Potomac
River, and described in a memorandum all the
difficulties and obstructions to be overcome in
rendering that river navigable from tide-water to
Fort Cumberland (Cumberland, Maryland). At
the time of Washington's entrance into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
House of Burgesses in 1760, the matter of a
way of communication between the colonies and
the territory then conquered from France beyond
the Alleghanies was perhaps uppermost in
his mind, but various circumstances compelled a
postponement of all such plans, particularly the
outrageous proclamation of 1763, which was
intended to repress the Western movement.</p>

<p>By 1770 conditions were changed. In 1768
the Treaty of Fort Stanwix had nominally secured
to Virginia all the territory south of the
Ohio River, the very land from which the proclamation
of 1763 excluded her.</p>

<p>On July 20 of this year, Washington wrote to
Thomas Johnson, the first State Governor of
Maryland, suggesting that the project of opening
the Potomac River be "recommended to
the public notice upon a more enlarged plan
[<i>i. e.</i>, including a portage to the Ohio Basin] and
as a means of becoming the channel of conveyance
of the extensive and valuable trade of a
rising empire." Johnson had written Washington
concerning the navigation of the Potomac;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
in this reply Washington prophesied the failure
of any plan to improve the Potomac that did
not include a plan to make it an avenue of
communication between the East and the West.
He also prophesied that, if this were not done,
Pennsylvania or New York would improve the
opportunity of getting into commercial touch
with that "rising empire" beyond the Alleghanies,
"a tract of country which," he wrote,
"is unfolding to our view, the advantages of
which are too great, and too obvious, I should
think, to become the subject of serious debate,
but which, through ill-timed parsimony and
supineness, may be wrested from us and conducted
through other channels, such as the
Susquehanna."</p>

<p>These words of Washington's had a significance
contained in no others uttered in that day, hinting
of a greater America of which few besides
this man were dreaming. They sounded through
the years foretelling the wonder of our time, the
making of the empire of the Mississippi Basin.
Far back in his youth, this man had sounded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
the same note of alarm and enthusiasm: "A
pusillanimous behavior now will ill suit the
times," he cried to Governor Dinwiddie just after
Braddock's defeat, when a red tide of pillage
and murder was setting over the mountains upon
Virginia and Pennsylvania. During the fifteen
years now past Washington had visited the West,
and understood its promise and its needs, and
now the binding of the East and the West
became at once his dearest dream.</p>

<p>Believing the time had come Washington, in
1774, brought before the Virginia House of
Burgesses a grand plan of communication which
called for the improvement of the Potomac and
the building of a connection from that river to
one of the southwest tributaries of the Ohio.
Only the outbreak of the Revolution could have
thwarted the measure; in those opening hours of
war it was forgotten, and it was not thought
of again until peace was declared seven years
later.</p>

<p>We know something of Washington's life in
those years&mdash;his ceaseless application to details,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
his total abandonment of the life he had learned
to know and love on the Mount Vernon farms,
the thousand perplexities, cares, and trials which
he met so patiently and nobly. But in those
days of stress and hardship the cherished plan of
youth and manhood could not be forgotten.
Even before peace was declared, Washington
left his camp at Newburg, and at great personal
risk made a tour though the Mohawk Valley, examining
the portages between the Mohawk and
Wood Creek, at Rome, New York, and between
Lake Otsego and the Mohawk at Canajoharie.
These routes by the Susquehanna and Mohawk
to the Lakes were the rival routes of the James
and Potomac westward, and Washington was
greatly interested in them. He was no narrow
partisan. Returning from this trip, he wrote
the Chevalier de Chastellux from Princeton,
October 12, 1783:</p>

<p class="bq">"Prompted by these actual observations, I could not
help taking a more extensive view of the vast inland navigation
of these United States and could not but be struck
with the immense extent and importance of it, and with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
the goodness of that Providence which has dealt its favors
to us with so profuse a hand. Would to God we may have
wisdom enough to improve them! I shall not rest contented
till I have explored the western country, and
traversed those lines, or great part of them, which have
given bounds to a new empire."</p>

<p>There is something splendid suggested by these
words. Though he knew, perhaps better than
any man, the pitiful condition of the country,
there is here no note of despair, but rather a cry
of enthusiasm. The leader of the armies was now
to become a leader of a people, and at the outset
his eye is uplifted and his faith great. With
prophetic genius his face, at the close of his exhausting
struggle, is turned toward the West.
It is certain that Washington could not have
known what a tremendous influence the new
West was to have in the perplexing after hours
of that critical period of our history. Perhaps
he judged better what it would be partly for the
reason that its very existence had furnished a
moral support to him in times of darkness and
despair; he always remembered those valleys
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
and open meadows where the battles of his boyhood
had been fought, and the tradition that he
would have led the Continental army thither in
case of final defeat may not be unfounded.
Whether he knew aught of the wholesome part
the West was to play in our national development
or not, two things are very clear to-day:
the West, and the opportunity to occupy it,
were the "main chance" of the spent colonies
at the end of that war; and if Washington had
known all that we know at this day, he certainly
could not have done much more than he did to
bring about the welding and cementing of the
East and the West, which now meant to each
other more than ever before. He again utters
practically the old cry of his youth: "A pusillanimous
behavior now will ill suit the times."
And the emphasis is on the "now."</p>

<p>It is not surprising, therefore, to find that
Washington, soon after reaching Mount Vernon,
at the close of the war, determined on another
western journey. The ostensible reason for the
trip was to look after his lands, but from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
journal of the traveller it is easy to see that
the important result of the trip was a personal
inspection of the means of communication between
the various branches of the Ohio and the
Potomac, which so nearly interlock in southwestern
Pennsylvania and northeastern West
Virginia. It must be remembered that in that
day river navigation was considered the most
practical form of transportation. All the rivers
of Virginia, great and small, were the highways
of the tobacco industry; the rivers of any colony
were placed high in an inventory of the colony's
wealth, not only because they implied fertility,
but because they were the great avenues of trade.
The first important sign of commercial awakening
in the interior of the colonies was the improvement
of the navigable rivers and the highways.</p>

<p>In less than thirty-three days Washington travelled
nearly seven hundred miles on horseback
in what is now Pennsylvania and West Virginia.
<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
That he did not confine his explorations</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>
<p>to the travelled ways is evident from his itinerary
through narrow, briery paths, and his remaining
for at least one night upon a Virginian
hillside, where he slept, as in earlier years, beside
a camp-fire and covered only by his cloak.
His original intention was to go to the Great
Kanawha, where much of his most valuable
land lay, and after transacting his business,
to return by way of the New River into Virginia.
But it will be remembered that after
the Revolutionary War closed in the East, the
bloodiest of battles were yet to be fought in
the West; and even in 1784, such was the condition
of affairs on the frontier, it did not seem
safe for Washington to go down the Ohio. He
turned, therefore, to the rough lands at the head
of the Monongahela, in the region of Morgantown,
West Virginia, and examined carefully
all evidence that could be secured touching the
practicability of opening a great trunk line of
communication between East and West by way
of the Potomac and Monongahela rivers. The
navigation of the headwaters of the two streams
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
was the subject of special inquiry, and then,
in turn, the most practicable route for a portage
or a canal between them.</p>

<p>From any point of view this hard, dangerous
tour of exploration must be considered most
significant. Washington had led his ragged
armies to victory, England had been fought
completely to a standstill, and the victor had
returned safely to the peace and quiet of his
Mount Vernon farms amid the applause of two
continents. And then, in a few weeks, we find
the same man with a single attendant beating
his way through the tangled trails in hilly West
Virginia, inspecting for himself and making
diligent inquiry from all he met concerning the
practicability of the navigation of the upper
Monongahela and the upper Potomac. Russia
can point to Peter's laboring in the Holland shipyards
with no more pride than that with which
we can point to Washington pushing his tired
horse through the wilderness about Dunkard's
Bottom on the Cheat River in 1784. If through
the knowledge and determination of Peter the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Russian Empire became strong, then as truly
from the clear-visioned inspiration of Washington
came the first attempts to bind our East and
West into one&mdash;a union on which depended
the very life of the American Republic. Here
and now we find this man firmly believing truths
and theories which became the adopted beliefs
of a whole nation but a few years later.</p>

<p>Returning to Mount Vernon, Washington
immediately penned one of the most interesting
and important letters written in America during
his day and generation,&mdash;"that classic, Washington's
Letter to Benjamin Harrison, 1784," as
it is styled in the "Old South Leaflets." In
this letter he voices passionately his plea for
binding a fragmentary nation together by the
ties of interstate communion and commerce.
His plan included the improvement of the
Potomac and one of the heads of the Monongahela,
and building a solid portage highway
between these waterways. His chief argument
was that Virginia ought to be the first in the
field to secure the trade of the West; with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
keener foresight than any other man of his day,
Washington saw that the trans-Alleghany empire
would be filled with people "faster than any
other ever was, or any one would imagine."
Not one of all the prophecies uttered during
the infancy of our Republic was more marvellously
fulfilled. The various means by which
this was accomplished changed more rapidly
than any one could have supposed, but every
change brought to pass more quickly that very
marvel which he had foretold to a wondering
people only half awake to its greater duty. His
final argument was prophetically powerful: he
had done what he could to lead his people to
freedom from proprietaries and lords of trade.
How free now would they be?</p>

<p>He wrote:</p>

<p class="bq">"No well informed Mind need be told, that the flanks
and rear of the United territory are possessed by other
powers, and formidable ones too&mdash;nor how necessary it
is to apply the cement of interest to bind all parts of it
together, by one indissoluble bond&mdash;particularly the
middle states with the Country immediately back of them&mdash;for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
what ties let me ask, should we have upon those
people; and how entirely unconnected sho{d} we be with
them if the Spaniards on their right or great Britain on
their left, instead of throwing stumbling blocks in their
way as they now do, should invite their trade and seek
alliances with them?&mdash;What, when they get strength,
which will be sooner than is generally imagined (from the
emigration of Foreigners who can have no predeliction
for us, as well as from the removal of our own Citizens)
may be the consequence of their having formed such
connections and alliances, requires no uncommon foresight
to predict.</p>

<p class="bq">"The Western Settlers&mdash;from my own observation&mdash;stand
as it were on a pivet&mdash;the touch of a feather would
almost incline them any way&mdash;they looked down the
Mississippi until the Spaniards (very impolitically I think
for themselves) threw difficulties in the way, and for no
other reason that I can conceive than because they glided
gently down the stream, without considering perhaps the
tedeousness of the voyage back, &amp; the time necessary to
perform it in;&mdash;and because they have no other means
of coming to us but by a long land transportation &amp;
unimproved Roads.</p>

<p class="bq">"A combination of circumstances make the present
conjuncture more favorable than any other to fix the trade
of the Western Country to our Markets.&mdash;The jealous
&amp; untoward disposition of the Spaniards on one side, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
the private views of some individuals coinciding with the
policy of the Court of G. Britain on the other, to retain
the posts of Oswego, Niagara, Detroit &amp;c<sup>a</sup> (which tho'
done under the letter of the treaty is certainly an infraction
of the Spirit of it, &amp; injurious to the Union) may be
improved to the greatest advantage by this State if she
would open her arms, &amp; embrace the means which are
necessary to establish it&mdash;The way is plain, &amp; the expense,
comparitively speaking deserves not a thought,
so great would be the prize&mdash;The Western Inhabitants
would do their part towards accomplishing it,&mdash;weak, as
they now are, they would, I am persuaded meet us half
way rather than be <i>driven</i> into the arms of, or be in any
wise dependent upon, foreigners; the consequences of
which would be, a separation, or a War.&mdash;</p>

<p class="bq">"The way to avoid both, happily for us, is easy, and
dictated by our clearest interest.&mdash;It is to open a wide
door, and make a smooth way for the Produce of that
Country to pass to our Markets before the trade may get
into another channel&mdash;this, in my judgment, would dry
up the other Sources; or if any part should flow down
the Mississippi, from the Falls of the Ohio, in Vessels
which may be built&mdash;fitted for Sea&mdash;&amp; sold with their
Cargoes, the proceeds I have no manner of doubt, will
return this way; &amp; that it is better to prevent an evil
than to rectify a mistake none can deny&mdash;commercial,
connections, of all others, are most difficult to dissolve&mdash;if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
we wanted proof of this, look to the avidity with which
we are renewing, after a <i>total</i> suspension of eight years, our
correspondence with Great Britain;&mdash;So, if we are supine,
and suffer without a struggle the Settlers of the Western
Country to form commercial connections with the Spaniards,
Britons, or with any of the States in the Union
we shall find it a difficult matter to dissolve them altho'
a better communication should, thereafter, be presented
to them&mdash;time only could effect it; such is the force
of habit!&mdash;</p>

<p class="bq">"Rumseys discovery of working Boats against stream, by
mechanical powers principally, may not only be considered
as a fortunate invention for these States in general but as
one of those circumstances which have combined to render
the present epoche favorable above all others for securing
(if we are disposed to avail ourselves of them) a large portion
of the produce of the Western Settlements, and of
the Fur and Peltry of the Lakes, also.&mdash;the importation
of which alone, if there were no political considerations
in the way, is immense.&mdash;</p>

<p class="bq">"It may be said, perhaps, that as the most direct Routs
from the Lakes to the Navigation of Potomack are through
the State of Pennsylvania;&mdash;and the inter{t} of that State
opposed to the extension of the Waters of Monongahela,
that a communication cannot be had either by the
Yohiogany or Cheat River;&mdash;but herein I differ.&mdash;an
application to this purpose would, in my opinion, place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
the Legislature of that Commonwealth in a very delicate
situation.&mdash;That it would not be pleasing I can readily
conceive, but that they would refuse their assent, I am by
no means clear in.&mdash;There is, in that State, at least one
hundred thousand Souls West of the Laurel hill, who are
groaning under the inconveniences of a long land transportation.&mdash;They
are wishing, indeed looking, for the
extension of inland Navigation; and if this can not be
made easy for them to Philadelphia&mdash;at any rate it must
be lengthy&mdash;they will seek a Mart elsewhere; and none
is so convenient as that which offers itself through
Yohiogany or Cheat River.&mdash;the certain consequences
therefore of an attempt to restrain the extension of the
Navigation of these Rivers, (so consonant with the interest
of these people) or to impose any extra: duties upon
the exports, or imports, to, or from another State, would
be a separation of the Western Settlers from the old &amp;
more interior government; towards which there is not
wanting a disposition at this moment in the former."</p>

<p>Thus the old dream of the youth is brought forward
again by the thoughtful, sober man; these
words echo the spirit of Washington's whole
attitude toward the West&mdash;its wealth of buried
riches, its commercial possibilities, its swarming
colonies of indomitable pioneers. Here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
was the first step toward solving that second
most serious problem that faced the young
nation: How can the great West be held and
made to strengthen the Union? France and
England had owned and lost it. Could the new
master, this infant Republic, "one nation to-day,
thirteen to-morrow," do better? Ay, but
England and France had no seer or adviser so
wise as this man. This letter from Washington
to Harrison was our nation's pioneer call to the
vastly better days (poor as they now seem) of
improved river navigation, the first splendid
economic advance that heralded the day of the
canal and the national highway. For fifty years,
until President Jackson vetoed the Maysville
Road Bill, the impetus of this appeal, made in
1784, was of vital force in forming our national
economic policies. This letter has frequently
been pointed to as the inspiring influence which
finally gave birth to the Erie Canal and the
Cumberland National Road.</p>

<p>The immediate result of this agitation was the
formation of the celebrated Potomac Company
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
under joint resolutions passed by Virginia and
Maryland. Washington was at once elected to
the presidency of this company, an office he
filled until his election to the presidency of the
United States five years later (1789). The plan
of the Potomac Company was to improve the
navigation of the Potomac to the most advantageous
point on its headwaters and build a
twenty-mile portage road to Dunkard's Bottom
on the Cheat River. With the improvement of
the Cheat and Monongahela rivers, a waterway,
with a twenty-mile portage, was secured from
the Ohio to tide-water on the Potomac.</p>

<p>Washington's plan, however, did not stop here.
This proposed line of communication was not to
stop at the Ohio, but the northern tributaries of
that river were to be explored and rendered navigable,
and portage roads were to be built between
them and the interlocking streams which
flowed into the Great Lakes. With the improvement
of these waterways, in their turn,
a complete trunk line of communication was
thus established from the Lakes to the sea.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Washington spent no little time in endeavoring
to secure the best possible information concerning
the nature of the northern tributaries of the
Ohio, the Beaver, the Muskingum, the Scioto,
and the Miami, and of the lake streams, the
Grand, the Cuyahoga, the Sandusky, and the
Maumee. It was because of such conceptions
as these that all the portage paths of the territory
northwest of the Ohio River were declared
by the famous Ordinance of 1787, "common
highways forever free."</p>

<p>The Potomac Company fared no better than
the other early companies which attempted to
improve the lesser waterways of America before
the method of slackwater navigation was discovered.
It made, however, the pioneer effort
in a cause which meant more to its age than we
can readily imagine to-day, and in time it built the
great and successful Chesapeake and Ohio Canal,
as the early attempts to render the Mohawk
River navigable were the first chapters in the
history of the famed Erie Canal. These efforts
of Washington's constitute likewise the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
chapter of the building of our one great national
road. This highway, begun in 1811, and completed
to the Ohio River in 1818, was practically
the portage path which was so important a link
in Washington's comprehensive plan. Its starting
point was Cumberland, Maryland, on the
Potomac, and it led to Brownsville, Pennsylvania,
on the Monongahela, and Wheeling on
the Ohio. All of these points were famous
ports in the days when that first burst of immigration
swept over the Alleghanies. Washington's
plan for a bond of union between East and
West was also the first chapter of the story of
throwing the first railway across the Alleghanies.
"I consider this among the most important acts
of my life," said Charles Carroll, of Carrollton,
when with the stroke of a pen he laid the first
foundation for the Baltimore and Ohio Railway,
"second only to my signing the Declaration of
Independence, if even it be second to that."</p>

<p>Washington's dream of an empire of united
States bound together by a "chain of federal
union" was enlarged and modified by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
changing needs of a nation, but in its vital essence
it was never altered. "It would seem," wrote the
late Herbert B. Adams, "as though, in one way
or another, all lines of our public policy lead
back to Washington, as all roads lead to Rome."
And yet, after all, I believe there are other
words which sound a note that should never die
in the ears of his people, and those are his own
youthful words, "A pusillanimous behavior now
will ill suit the times."</p>

<p>It is not easy to pass this subject without referring
to Washington's remarkably wise foresight
with reference to the West and national growth
which his experience with that part of the country
gave him. True, he made some miscalculations,
as when he expressed the opinion that New York
would not improve her great route to the West
(Mohawk River route) until the British had given
up their hold on the Great Lakes; he however
pointed to that route as one of the most important
in America and hardly expected more
from it than has been realized. In all phases of
the awakening of the West&mdash;the Mississippi
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
question, the organization of the Northwest Territory,
the formulating of the Ordinance of 1787
("the legal outcome of Maryland's successful
policy in advocating National Sovereignty over
the Western Lands"), the ceding of lands to the
National Government, the handling of the Indian
problem&mdash;Washington's influence and knowledge
were of paramount usefulness. Take these instances
of his prescience as yet unmentioned: he
suggested, in connection with the Potomac improvement,
the policy of exploration and surveys
which our government has steadily adhered to
since that day; the Lewis and Clark expedition
was a result of this policy advocated first by
Washington. Again, note Washington's singularly
wise opinion on the separation of Kentucky
from Virginia. Writing to Jefferson in 1785, he
affirms that the general opinion in his part of Virginia
is unfavorable to the separation. "I have
uniformly given it as mine," he wrote, "to meet
them upon their own ground, draw the best line,
and make the best terms we can, and part good
friends." And again, it is to the point to notice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
Washington's far-seeing view of the progress and
enterprise of the West in relation to commerce.
Who before him ever had the temerity to suggest
that ships would descend the Ohio River and
sail for foreign ports?<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Yet he said this in 1784
and had the audacity to add that, if so, the return
route of the proceeds of all sales thus resulting
would be over the Alleghany routes, which
prophecy was fulfilled to the very letter.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">I<span class="smcap">n</span>
early days in
North Carolina,
the young man
who desired to
practise law was
compelled to get
a certificate from
the Chief Justice
of the colony and
to present this
to the Governor;
the latter examined
the candidate,
and, becoming satisfied as to his attainments,
granted him a license. Almost a century and a
half ago a youth presented himself to the Governor
of that colony with the proper credentials
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
and asked that he be examined for admission to
the bar. His name, he affirmed, was Richard
Henderson. His father, Samuel Henderson, had
moved from Virginia in 1745, Richard's tenth
year, and was now Sheriff of Granville County.
Richard had assisted his father "in the business
of the sherifftry," and, with a few books, had
picked up his knowledge of law.</p>

<p>All this the Governor of North Carolina
learned with indifference, we can imagine, as he
looked the broad-shouldered lad up and down.
It may be that North Carolina had now a surplus
of pettifoggers; at any rate the Governor was
not granting licenses with a free hand to-day.
The youth was not voluble, though his firm
square jaw denoted both sturdiness and determination;
perhaps he was somewhat abashed, as he
well may have been, in the presence of the chief
executive of the colony.</p>

<p>"How long have you read law?" asked the
Governor.</p>

<p>"A twelve-month," answered the lad.</p>

<p>"And what books have you read?" We can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
fancy there was the tinge of a sneer in these
words. Henderson named his books. If the
sneer was hidden until now, it instantly appeared
as the young applicant was bluntly told that it
was nonsense for him to appear for an examination
after such a short period of study of such
a limited number of books.</p>

<p>The firm jaws were clinched and the gray eyes
snapped as the rebuke was administered. Despite
his homely exterior and unpolished address
the boy was already enough of a jurist to love
justice and fair play; if silent under many circumstances,
he could speak when the time
demanded speech.</p>

<p>"Sir," he replied,&mdash;and it can be believed there
was a ring to the words,&mdash;"I am an applicant
for examination: it is your duty to examine me;
if I am found worthy, I should be granted a
license, and if not, I should be refused one, not
before."</p>

<p>We can be sure that the Governor bristled up
at hearing his duty outlined to him from the lips
of a country boy; and it is no less probable that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
as he began an examination it was wholly with
the intention of demoralizing utterly the spirit of
the youth who had spoken so boldly. The answers
did not come so rapidly, probably, as the
questions were asked, nor were they formulated
with equal nicety; but the substance was there,
of sufficient quantity and sturdy quality, and in
short order the Governor, who was a gentleman,
found himself admiring the cool, discerning lad
who had the confidence of his convictions. The
license was granted and with it a bountiful degree
of honest praise.</p>

<p>Young Henderson immediately began the
practice of law and was increasingly successful;
before the outbreak of the Revolution he was
judge on the bench of the Superior Court of
North Carolina. As early as 1774 North Carolina
was convulsed in the Revolutionary contest,
and in that year the Colonial government was
abolished there.</p>

<p>The student will search in vain to find the
earliest motive which led Judge Henderson to
turn his eyes to the westward at this juncture.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
Yet since he had come of age he had witnessed
important events: the French and Indian War
had been fought and won; Pontiac's rebellion
had been put down; the famous treaty of Fort
Stanwix, which gave Virginia all the territory
between the Ohio and Tennessee rivers, had
been signed; and now in 1774, when North
Carolina was in the throes of revolution,
Governor Dunmore of Virginia and General
Andrew Lewis defeated the savage Shawnees
who had attempted to challenge Virginia's right
to the land south of the Ohio. The stories of
the first explorers of the hinterland beyond the
Alleghanies&mdash;Walker, Gist, Washington, and
Boone&mdash;were now attracting more attention as
people began to believe that the Indians could,
after all, be made to keep their treaty pledges.
As the Revolutionary fires raged in North
Carolina, many turned their eyes to the fresh
green lands beyond the mountains of which the
"Long Hunters" and Boone had told. Were
those dreams true? Was there a pleasant
land beyond dark Powell's Valley and darker
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Cumberland Gap where the British would cease
from troubling, and honest men, as well as criminals
and debtors, would be at rest? The hope in
one man's breast became a conviction, and the
conviction a firm purpose. Judge Henderson
resolved to form a Transylvania Company, secure
a large tract of land, and lead a colony into the
sweet meadows of Ken-ta-kee.</p>

<p>It is not known when or how Judge Henderson
learned that the Cherokees would sell
a portion of their Western hunting grounds.
It may have been only a borderland rumor;
perhaps it came directly from the wigwams of
the Indians at the mouth of a "Long Hunter,"
possibly a Boone or a Harrod. Somehow it did
come, and Henderson resolved immediately to
make a stupendous purchase and follow it up
with a remarkable emigration. It will be proper
to add at once that there is as little probability
that the Cherokees had a legal right to sell as
that Henderson had to buy; but neither party
stood on technicalities. Virginia's sweeping
claims, made good by daring politics at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
treaty of Fort Stanwix, covered all the territory
between the Ohio and the Tennessee. A Virginian
law forbade the private purchase of land
from the Indians, though Virginia herself had
acquired it by flagrantly evading the plain meaning
of the King's proclamation of 1763 in making
such a purchase from the Six Nations. And
the claim of the Six Nations to possession of
the Old Southwest was less substantial than
that of the Cherokees who still hunted there.</p>

<p>Passing, then, these technicalities as lightly
as Virginia and Henderson did (a common failing
in the rough old days when this region was
but a moaning forest), let us look quickly to
the West. Henderson's plan was admirably
laid. He at once took into his service the cool
and trusty Daniel Boone. The latter was posted
off to that most distant of borderland communities,
the Watauga Settlement, to arrange a
meeting between the officers of the Transylvania
Company and the chiefs of the Cherokees.
And here, at the famed Sycamore Shoals on
this Watauga tributary of the Tennessee, on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
the 17th of March, 1775, Richard Henderson
signed the treaty of Fort Watauga. His business
associates were Judge John Williams,
Leonard Henley Bullock, James Hogg, Nathaniel
Thomas, David Hart, John Luttrell,
and William Johnstone. But even the well-informed
Boone could not make all things move
smoothly, and there were delays ere the vast
tract of twenty million acres lying south of
the Kentucky River was satisfactorily secured.
The Cherokee chieftain, Oconostota, opposed the
treaty, and the stipulation named, ten thousand
pounds sterling in goods; he made, it is said,
one of the "most eloquent orations that ever
fell from red man's lips," against Boone and
Henderson. At the close the quiet promoter,
who "could be silent in English and two
Indian languages," met the Indian orator apart
and alone. No one ever knew what passed
between them, but the treaty of Fort Watauga
was duly signed. All was ready now for the
advance movement, and Henderson immediately
employed Daniel Boone to move forward to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
mark the path to the Kentucky River, where
the settlement was to be made. Felix Walker
was one of the band of woodsmen assembled
by Boone to assist in this task of marking out
for white men the Indian path through Cumberland
Gap. "Colonel Boone ... was to be
our pilot," Walker records, "through the wilderness,
to the promised land."</p>

<p>Kentucky was a promised land; it was promised
by the Cherokees, and none knew better
than the savage Shawnees that Cherokee promises
were worth no more than their own. In
1773 and 1774 numbers of the half-civilized
pioneers had been pressing into Kentucky, and
in the latter year cabins had been raised in
many quarters. Whether or not there was any
sign of genuine permanency in these beginnings,
Dunmore's War, which broke out in 1774, put
everything at hazard; the Kentucky movement
was seemingly destroyed for the time being.
For this reason it is that the Henderson purchase
at Fort Watauga in March, 1775, was of
as precious moment and providential timeliness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
as perhaps any other single private enterprise in
our early history. As will be seen, the Ohio
Company played a most important role in the
history of the West in 1787, by making possible
the famous Ordinance; but the filling of Kentucky
in 1775 was more important at that hour
than any other social movement at any other
hour in Western history.</p>

<p>For Henderson "meant business": this was
not a get-rich-quick scheme that he was foisting
upon others. He came to Watauga in the
expectation of proceeding onward to the farlying
land he would buy&mdash;a man willing to
make great personal as well as financial risk in
a venture more chimerical in its day than the
incorporation of an airship freight line would
be to-day. And by the twentieth of March,
Henderson was ready to push westward, along
that winding line of wounded trees, up hill and
down valley, to the Gap and beyond into the
wilderness which lay between the Cumberland
Mountains and the meadow lands of
Kentucky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>Leaving Fort Watauga March 20, the party,
chief of which were Henderson, Hart, and
Luttrell, reached Captain Joseph Martin's station
in Powell's Valley on the thirtieth. Of the
experiences of these men, recounted so interestingly
in Henderson's little yellow diary, nothing
is so significant as the parties of pioneers which
they soon began to meet retreating from Kentucky.
The first of these hurrying bands of
fugitives was encountered as early as April 7,
and between that date and April 19 at least
seventy-six fugitives from the "dark and bloody
ground" met and passed Henderson's little
colony of forty. Lewis's victory of the Summer
before had embittered the savages beyond all
words; and now, as the Spring of 1775 dawned
in the lonely mountain valleys, these first adventurers
into Kentucky were hurrying eastward.
And this dread of Indian hostility was not a
chimera; even as Boone's party was hacking its
route to the Kentucky River, it was ambushed
in camp by an Indian horde, which assailed it
when night was darkest, just before dawn; one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
man was killed and two were wounded, one of
them fatally.</p>

<p>Now it was that Boone sent Henderson those
thrilling words which can be understood only
when we realize that the Indian marauders were
driving out of Kentucky the entire van which
came there and began settling in 1774. "My
advice to you, Sir," wrote Boone from that
bloody battleground on the trail, "is to come or
send as soon as possible. Your company is desired
greatly, for the people are very uneasy, but
are willing to stay and venture their lives with
you, and now is the time to frustrate the intentions
of the Indians, and keep the country whilst
we are in it. If we give way to them now, it
will ever be the case."</p>

<p>There is, unfortunately, no portrait of Richard
Henderson in existence; if one picture by some
magic art could be secured, those who are
proudest of his memory could surely prefer no
scene to this: a man a little above average
height, broad of shoulders but not fleshy, clad in
the rough garb of the typical pioneer, standing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
in Boone's trail on a ragged spur of the gray-grained
Cumberlands, pleading with a pale-faced,
disheartened Kentucky pioneer, to turn about,
join his company, and return to the Kentucky
River. For this was the mission of his life&mdash;to
give heart to that precious movement into Kentucky
at this critical first hour of her history. A
beginning had been made, but it was on the
point of being swept from its feet. The Transylvania
Company, led with courage and confidence
by Boone and Henderson, ignored the
fears of fugitives and triumphed splendidly in
the face of every known and many unknown
fears.</p>

<p>At noon of Saturday, April 8, Henderson and
his followers were toiling up the ascent into Cumberland
Gap. On this day a returning party as
large as Henderson's was encountered. "Met
about 40 persons returning from the Cantuckey,"
wrote Henderson in his diary. "On Acct. of
the Late Murder by the Indians, could prevail
one [on] one only to return. Memo. Several
Virginians who were with us returned." On the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
twelfth another company of fugitives was met
on Richmond Creek; William Calk, one of
Henderson's party, jotted this down in his journal:
"There we met another Company going
back [to Virginia]; they tell such News Abram
and Drake is afraid to go aney further." This
"Abram " was Abraham Hanks, uncle of Nancy
Hanks, the mother of Abraham Lincoln. But
pushing bravely on, Henderson and his daring
associates reached the site of the new Boonesborough
(Fort Boone, Henderson called it) on
the twentieth of April.</p>

<p>From this it is well to date the founding
of a genuine settlement in Kentucky, one day
after the rattle of that running fire of muskets
at Lexington and Concord which rang around
the world. In an indefinite sense, there were
settlements in Kentucky before this; but no
promoter-friend of Kentucky ever coaxed back
over the Cumberland Mountains any of the
founders of Boonesborough! True, Boonesborough
itself did not exist permanently; but not
because the land was deserted. Boonesborough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
was not on the direct line from Cumberland
Gap to the "Falls of the Ohio" (Louisville),
and did not play the part in later Kentucky
history that Harrodsburg and Crab Orchard did.
It was, however, the first important fortified
Kentucky station, and its builders, chief of whom
was Richard Henderson, received their heroic
inspiration from no persons or parties in existence
in Kentucky when they came thither. Henderson's
determination to hold the ground gained
is seen in the following letter written in July,
1775, to Captain Martin, in Powell's Valley,
who had just given the Indians a bloody check:
"... Your spirited conduct gives me great
pleasure. Keep your men in heart if possible;
now is your time, the Indians must not drive
us." A touch of the loneliness of Judge Henderson's
situation is sensed in another letter to
Martin: "I long much to hear from you," he
writes from the banks of the far-away Kentucky,
"pray write me at large, how the matter goes
with you in the valley, as well as what passes in
Virginia."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>Little wonder he was anxious concerning Virginia's
attitude toward his purchase and the bold
advance of his party of colonizers, from which
several Virginians had deserted. There could be
no doubt of Virginia's opinion of these North
Carolinians who had taught that colony what
could be done in the West by brave, determined
men. Henderson's purchase was annulled, and
Henderson and his compatriots were described
as vagabond interlopers, in a governor's anathema.
Before this was known, Henderson issued
a regular call for a meeting of the colonists
to take the initial steps of forming a State
government. But all that Henderson planned
is not to our purpose here. A rush of Virginians
through the doorway in Cumberland Gap, which
Boone and Henderson had opened, swept the
inchoate state of Transylvania from record and
almost from memory. The Transylvania Company
never survived the Virginia governor's
proclamation, North Carolina joining Virginia in
repudiating the private purchase. Actual settlers
on Henderson's purchase, however, were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
permitted to remain in title; and, in return for
the money expended by Henderson and his associates,
Virginia granted his company two hundred
thousand acres of land in the vicinity of Henderson,
Kentucky; and North Carolina granted an
equal amount in Carter's Valley near the Cumberland
Mountains. In each case the actual
acreage was about double that mentioned in
the grant.</p>

<p>But this appropriation of nearly a million acres
to the Henderson Company cannot be viewed at
this day as other than a payment for great value
received. From any standpoint Richard Henderson's
brave advance into Kentucky, in April,
1775, must be considered one of the most heroic
displays of that typical American spirit of comprehensive
aggrandizement of which so much is
heard to-day. Its great value may be guessed
from the moral effect of the founding of Fort
Boone at the critical hour when the Revolutionary
flames, so long burning in secret, burst forth
to enlighten the world. It meant much to the
East that Henderson and Boone should prove
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
that a settlement on the lower Ohio Basin could
be made and maintained; it meant everything
to the infant West that Kentucky should so soon
begin to fill with men, women, and children.
The debt of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois to Kentucky
can never be paid and probably never will
be appropriately recognized. The lands north of
the Ohio were freed from savage dominion largely
by the raiding Kentuckians. It is certain that
the most spectacular campaign in Western history,
Clark's conquest of Illinois, would never have
taken place in 1778 if Henderson and Boone had
not placed the possibility of successful Kentucky
immigration beyond a reasonable doubt in 1775.</p>

<p>Judge Henderson returned to North Carolina
upon the failure of the Transylvania Company,
no doubt depressed and disappointed. The later
allotment of land to the Transylvania Company
by Virginia and North Carolina in part annulled
the severe early defamatory charges of the Virginia
governor. He lived to a peaceful old age,
and lies buried near his old colonial mansion
near Williamstown, North Carolina.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>Boonesborough is well remembered as Boone's
Fort; but it is unjust to forget that Boone was
acting in the employ of Richard Henderson, the
founder of Transylvania.</p>

than the founding

moment when Washington was calling upon
Virginia, and all the colonies, to seize the West

another name for opportunity to the spent colonies

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Rufus Putnam</span><br />
  <i>Leader of the Founders of Marietta, Ohio</i></div>
</div>

<p>The hero of the movement, General Rufus
Putnam, was one of those plain, sturdy, noble
men whom it is a delight to honor. He was born
at Sutton, Massachusetts, April 9, 1738, and was
thus six years younger than Washington, who
always honored him. With little education,
save that gained from a few books bought with
pennies earned by blacking boots and running
errands for guests at his illiterate stepfather's
inn, he became a self-made man of the best
type,&mdash;the man who seizes every advantage
from book and friend to reach a high plane
and scan a wider horizon. The Old French War
was the training school for the Revolutionary
conflict; and here, with Gates and Mercer and
Washington and St. Clair and Wayne and
Gladwin and Gibson, Rufus Putnam learned
to love his country as only those can who have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
been willing to risk and wreck their all in her
behalf.</p>

<p>Then came the Revolution. In the first act
of the glorious yet pitiful drama Rufus Putnam
stands out conspicuously; for "we take no leaf
from the pure chaplet of Washington's fame,"
affirmed Senator Hoar, of Massachusetts, "when
we say that the success of the first great military
operation of the Revolution was due to Rufus
Putnam." The story is of intrinsic interest.
On a winter's evening in 1776, Rufus Putnam
was invited to dine at the headquarters of the
Commander-in-chief in the camp before Boston.
After the dinner party had broken up, Washington
detained him with questions concerning the
proper policy to be pursued with reference to
the future plan of campaign. As is well known,
Washington favored an entrenchment on Dorchester
Heights which would bring on a second
Bunker Hill with a fair chance of victory, rather
than the alternative of marching upon the city
across the ice-bound waters. But the frozen
state of the ground was a serious handicap in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
any entrenchment plan at that moment. Putnam
was asked in short how the equivalent of
entrenchments could be erected; the solving of
the question meant the deliverance of Massachusetts
from the burden of British occupation.
This son of the State was equal to the
moment, and his own simple account of the
means adopted is exceptionally interesting:</p>

<p class="bq">"I left headquarters in company with another gentleman,
and on our way came by General Heath's. I had
no thoughts of calling until I came against his door, and
then I said, 'Let us call on General Heath,' to which he
agreed. I had no other motive but to pay my respects
to the general. While there, I cast my eye on a book
which lay on the table, lettered on the back 'MÃ¼ller's
Field Engineer.' I immediately requested the general
to lend it to me. He denied me. I repeated my request.
He again refused, and told me he never lent his
books. I then told him that he must recollect that he
was one who, at Roxbury, in a measure compelled me
to undertake a business which, at the time, I confessed
I never had read a word about, and that he must let
me have the book. After some more excuses on his
part and close pressing on mine I obtained the loan
of it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p class="bq">
"In looking at the table of contents," writes Senator
Hoar, "his eye was caught by the word 'chandelier,' a
new word to him. He read carefully the description and
soon had his plan ready. The chandeliers were made of
stout timbers, ten feet long, into which were framed posts,
five feet high and five feet apart, placed on the ground in
parallel lines and the open spaces filled in with bundles of
fascines, strongly picketed together, thus forming a movable
parapet of wood instead of earth, as heretofore done.
The men were immediately set to work in the adjacent
apple orchard and woodlands, cutting and bundling up
the fascines and carrying them with the chandeliers on to
the ground selected for the work. They were put in their
place in a single night.</p>

<p class="bq">"When the sun went down on Boston on the 4th of
March, Washington was at Cambridge, and Dorchester
Heights were as nature or the husbandman had left them
in the autumn. When Sir William Howe rubbed his eyes
on the morning of the 5th, he saw through the heavy
mists, the entrenchments, on which, he said, the rebels
had done more work in a night than his whole army
would have done in a month. He wrote to Lord Dartmouth
that it must have been the employment of at least
twelve thousand men. His own effective force, including
seamen, was but about eleven thousand. Washington
had but fourteen thousand fit for duty. 'Some of our
officers,' said the 'Annual Register,'&mdash;I suppose Edmund
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
Burke was the writer,&mdash;'acknowledged that the expedition
with which these works were thrown up, with their
sudden and unexpected appearance, recalled to their
minds the wonderful stories of enchantment and invisible
agency which are so frequent in the Eastern
Romances.' Howe was a man of spirit. He took the
prompt resolution to attempt to dislodge the Americans
the next night before their works were made impregnable.
Earl Percy, who had learned something of Yankee quality
at Bunker Hill and Lexington, was to command the
assault. But the Power that dispersed the Armada,
baffled all the plans of the British general. There came
'a dreadful storm at night,' which made it impossible to
cross the bay until the American works were perfected.
The Americans, under Israel Putnam, marched into Boston,
drums beating and colors flying. The veteran British
army, aided by a strong naval force, soldier and sailor,
Englishman and Tory, sick and well, bag and baggage,
got out of Boston before the strategy of Washington, the
engineering of Putnam, and the courage of the despised
and untried yeomen, from whose leaders they withheld
the usual titles of military respect. 'It resembled,' said
Burke, 'more the emigration of a nation than the breaking
up of a camp.'"</p>

<p>His later solid achievements during the war
made him, in Washington's estimation, the best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
engineer in the army, whether French or American,
and "to be a great engineer with only such
advantages of education as Rufus Putnam enjoyed,
is to be a man of consummate genius."
A sober, brave man of genius was required to
lead to a successful issue the great work to
which Rufus Putnam was now providentially
called.</p>

<p>The vast territory between the Alleghanies
and the Mississippi came into the possession of
the United States at the close of the Revolution.
Then it was made possible for Congress to grant
the bounty-lands promised to soldiers at the beginning
of the war, and likewise to redeem its
worthless script in Western lands. This a grateful
government was willing to do, but the question
was vast and difficult. If occupied, the
territory must be governed. Few more serious
problems faced the young Republic.</p>

<p>The question was practically solved by two
men, Rufus Putnam and that noble clergyman,
Manasseh Cutler, pastor of the Congregational
church at Ipswich, Massachusetts. Through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
Putnam, a large body of officers and men had
petitioned Congress urgently for Western land:
"Ten years ago you promised bounties in lands,"
was Putnam's appeal now to Congress through
General Washington; "we have faithfully performed
our duty, as history will record. We
come to you now and ask that, in redemption
of your promise, you give us homes in that
Western wilderness. We will hew down the
forests, and therein erect temples to the living
God, raise and educate our children to serve and
love and honor the nation for which their fathers
fought, cultivate farms, build towns and cities,
and make that wilderness the pride and glory
of the nation." The Ohio Company of Associates
was organized at the Bunch of Grapes Tavern,
in Boston, March 1, 1786, by the election
of Rufus Putnam, chairman, and Winthrop Sargent,
secretary. As the agent of this organization,
Dr. Cutler hastened to New York, while the
famous Ordinance of 1787 was pending. This
instrument had been before Congress for three
years, but was passed within twelve days after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
this hero-preacher and skilled diplomat came to
New York. The Ordinance organized, from
lands ceded to the general government by the
several States, the magnificent tract known as
the Territory Northwest of the River Ohio.
The delay had been caused by the hazard of
erecting a great Territory, to be protected at
heavy expense, without having it occupied by
a considerable number of worthy citizens. The
Ohio Company of Associates had offered to take
a million and a half acres. This was unsatisfactory
to the delegates in Congress. It was a
mere clearing in all that vast tract stretching
from the Alleghany to the Wisconsin. Dr.
Cutler hastened to New York to reconcile the
parties interested.</p>


<div class="figcenter bord"><a name="illo_121.jpg" id="illo_121.jpg"></a>
  <img src="images/illo_121.jpg" width="489" height="600"
      alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Rev. Manasseh Cutler</span><br />
  <i>Ohio Pioneer</i></div>
</div>

<p>The situation was prophetically unique. The
Northwest Territory could not be organized
safely without the very band of colonizers which
Cutler represented and of which Putnam was
the leader. On the other hand, the Ohio Company
could not secure Western land without
being assured that it was to be an integral part
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
of the country for which they had fought. Putnam's
appeal read: "All we ask is that it shall
be consecrated to us and our children forever,
with the blessing of that Declaration which,
proclaimed to the world and sustained by our
arms, established as self-evident that all men
are created equal; that they are endowed by
their Creator with certain inalienable rights;
that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness, and that to secure these ends,
governments are instituted among men, deriving
their just power from the consent of the governed."
Thus the famed Ordinance and the
Ohio Company's purchase went hand in hand;
each was impossible without the other. In order
to realize the hope of his clients on the one hand,
and satisfy the demands of the delegates in
Congress on the other, Dr. Cutler added to
the grant of the Ohio Company an additional
one of three and a half million acres for a Scioto
Company. Thus, by a stupendous speculation
(so unhappy in its result, though compromising
in no way the Ohio Company or its agents),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
and by shrewdly, though without dissimulation,
making known his determination to buy land
privately from one of the individual States if
Congress would not now come to terms, Dr.
Cutler won a signal victory. The Ordinance
of 1787 was passed, corrected to the very letter
of his own amendments, and the United States
entered into the largest private contract it had
ever made.</p>

<p>With the passing of the Ordinance and the
signing of the indented agreement for the Ohio
Company by Cutler and Sargent on the 27th
of October of that most memorable year in
our documentary annals, a new era of Western
history dawned. Up to that moment, there had
been only illegal settlements between the Ohio
River and the Great Lakes&mdash;Zeisberger's Moravians
on the Tuscarawas. On numerous occasions
troops had been sent from Pittsburg
(Fort Pitt) to drive away from the northern
side of the Ohio settlers who had squatted on
the Seven Ranges, which Congress had caused
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
to be surveyed westward from the Pennsylvania
line. It being difficult to reach these squatters
from Pittsburg, Fort Harmar was erected at the
mouth of the Muskingum, in 1785, where troops
were kept to drive off intruders, protect the surveyors,
and keep the Indians in awe. The Ohio
Company's purchase extended from the seventh
through the seventeenth range, running northward
far enough to include the necessary amount
of territory. It was natural, then, that the capital
of the new colony should be located at the
mouth of the Muskingum, under the guns of
the fort.</p>

<p>The New Englanders who formed the Ohio
Company were not less determined in their
venture than were the North Carolinians who
formed the Transylvania Company thirteen
years before; and, though the founders of Marietta,
Ohio, ran no such risk (it has been said) as
did the founders of Boonesborough, Kentucky,
we of to-day can have no just appreciation of the
toil and the wearing years which these founders
of the Old Northwest now faced. Yet danger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
and fear were no novelty to them. How fitting
it was that these men, who first entered the portals
of the Northwest, bearing in their hands the
precious Ordinance and guided by the very star
of empire, should have been in part the heroes
of the two wars which saved this land from its
enemies. One cannot look unmoved upon that
body of travellers who met at daybreak, December
6, 1787, before Dr. Cutler's home at Ipswich,
to receive his blessing before starting. Theirs
was no idle ambition. No Moravian, no Jesuit
with beads and rosary, ever faced the Western
wilderness with a fairer purpose. In Kentucky,
the Virginians had gained, and were holding with
powerful grasp, the fair lands of <i>Ken-ta-kee</i>;
elsewhere the Black Forest loomed dark and
foreboding. Could the New Englanders do
equally well?</p>

<p>Their earnestness was a prophecy of their
great success. In December the first party of
carpenters and boat-builders, under Major Hatfield
White, started on the westward journey,
and in January 1788 the remainder of the brave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
vanguard, under Colonel Ebenezer Sproat and
General Rufus Putnam, followed. These were
the forty-eight "Founders of Ohio." The rigors
of a northern winter made the long journey over
Forbes's, or the Pennsylvania Road, a most exhaustive
experience. This road through Lancaster,
Carlisle, Shippensburg, and Bedford was
from this time forward a connecting link between
New England and Ohio. It was a rough
gorge of a road ploughed deep by the heavy
wheels of many an army wagon. Near Bedford,
Pennsylvania, the road forked; the northern
fork ran on to Pittsburg; the southern,
struck off southwestwardly to the Youghiogheny
River and the lower Ohio. This branch the
New England caravan followed to Sumrill's
Ferry on the Youghiogheny, the present West
Newton, Pennsylvania. Here Putnam planned
to build a rude flotilla and descend the Youghiogheny,
Monongahela, and Ohio to Fort Harmar.
The severe winter prevented immediate building
of this fleet, but by April all was in readiness.
The main boat was a covered galley, forty-five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
feet long, which was most appropriately named
the "Adventure Galley." The heavy baggage
was carried on a flat boat and a large canoe.</p>

<p>Of the men who formed Putnam's company
what more can be said&mdash;or what less&mdash;than
what Senator Hoar has left in his eloquent centennial
oration at Marietta in 1888?</p>

<p class="bq">"The stately figures of illustrious warriors and statesmen,
the forms of sweet and comely matrons, living and
real as if you had seen them yesterday, rise before you
now. Varnum, than whom a courtlier figure never entered
the presence of a queen,&mdash;soldier, statesman, scholar,
orator,&mdash;whom Thomas Paine, no mean judge, who had
heard the greatest English orators in the greatest days
of English eloquence, declared the most eloquent man he
had ever heard speak; Whipple, gallant seaman as ever
trod a deck,&mdash;a man whom Farragut or Nelson would
have loved as a brother, first of the glorious procession
of American naval heroes, first to fire an American gun
at the flag of England on the sea, first to unfurl the flag
of his own country on the Thames, first pioneer of the
river commerce of the Ohio to the Gulf; Meigs, hero of
Sagg Harbor, of the march to Quebec, of the storming
of Stony Point, the Christian gentleman and soldier,
whom the Cherokees named the White Path, in token
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
of the unfailing kindness and inflexible faith which had
conveyed to their darkened minds some not inadequate
conception of the spirit of Him who is the Way, the
Truth, and the Life; Parsons, soldier, scholar, judge, one
of the strongest arms on which Washington leaned, who
first suggested the Continental Congress, from the story
of whose life could almost be written the history of the
Northern War; the chivalric and ingenious Devol, said by
his biographer to be 'the most perfect figure of a man
to be seen amongst a thousand'; the noble presence of
a Sproat; the sons of Israel Putnam and Manasseh Cutler;
Fearing, and Greene, and Goodale, and the Gilmans;
Tupper, leader in Church and State, the veteran of a hundred
exploits, who seems, in the qualities of intellect and
heart, like a twin brother of Rufus Putnam; the brave
and patriotic, but unfortunate St. Clair, first Governor of
the Northwest, President of the Continental Congress;&mdash;the
mighty shades of these heroes and their companions
pass before our eyes, beneath the primeval forest, as the
shades of the Homeric heroes before Ulysses in the Land
of Asphodel."</p>

<p>It did not argue that the New Englanders
on the Ohio could hold their ground simply because
the Kentucky movement had been for over
a decade such a marvellous success. Its very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
success was the chief menace of the Kentucky
problem. The eyes of five thousand Indians
were fastened there, for from Kentucky had come
army after army, driving the savages northward
out of the valleys of the Muskingum, Scioto,
and Miami Rivers, until now they hovered
about the western extremity of Lake Erie. By
a treaty signed at Fort McIntosh in 1786, the
Indians had sold to the United States practically
all of eastern and southern Ohio. And so the
settlement at the mouth of the Muskingum at
this critical moment was in every sense a test
settlement. There was a chance that the savages
would forget the Kentuckians who had
driven them back to the Lakes and made possible
the Ohio Company settlement and turn
upon the New Englanders themselves who now
landed at the mouth of the Muskingum on the
7th of April, 1788, and began their home-building
on the opposite bank of the Muskingum from
Fort Harmar.</p>

<p>Here sprang up the rude pioneer settlement
which was to be, for more than a year, the capital
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
of the great new Territory&mdash;forever the historic
portal of the Old Northwest. These Revolutionary
soldiers under Putnam combined the
two names Marie Antoinette, and named their
capital Marietta in memory of the faithfulness
of Frenchmen and France to the patriot cause.
Here arose the stately forest-castle, the Campus
Martius, and near it was built the office of
the Ohio Company, where General Putnam carried
on, in behalf of the Ohio Company, the
important business of the settlement. In July,
1788, Governor St. Clair arrived, and with imposing
ceremony the great Territory was formally
established and its governor inaugurated.</p>

<p>Putnam's brave dream had come true. The
best blood and brain of New England were now
on the Ohio to shape forever the Old Northwest
and the great States to be made from it. The
soldiers were receiving the promised bounties,
and an almost worthless half-a-million dollars
had been redeemed in lands worth many millions.
The scheme of colonization, which was
but a moment before a thing of words and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
paper, became a living, moving influence of immense
power. Another New England on the
Ohio arose full-armed from the specifications of
the great Ordinance and the daring confidence
of Rufus Putnam and his colony. South of
the Ohio, the miserable Virginia system of land ownership
by tomahawk-claim was in force from
the Monongahela to the Tennessee; north of
the Ohio, the New England township system
prevailed. South of the Ohio, slavery was
permitted and encouraged; to the northward,
throughout the wide empire included within the
Ordinance, slavery was forever excluded. Two
more fundamental differences could not have
existed. And to these might be added the
encouragement given by the Ordinance to religion
and education. The coming of the Ohio
Company to Marietta meant many things to
many men, but the one great fundamental fact
is of most importance. The founding of Marietta
by Rufus Putnam in reality made possible
the Ordinance of 1787&mdash;of which Daniel Webster
said, "I doubt whether one single law of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
any lawgiver, ancient or modern, has produced
effects of more distinct, marked, and lasting
character."</p>

<p>The heroic movement which has justly given
Rufus Putnam the title "Father of Ohio" has
been one of the marvellous successes of the first
century of our national expansion. Three other
settlements were made on the Ohio in 1788 near
Cincinnati by sons of New Jersey. Within ten
years, Connecticut sent a brave squad of men
through the wilderness of New York to found
Cleveland; Virginia sent of her brain and blood
to found one of the most important settlements
in Ohio in the fair Scioto valley. These four
settlements, before 1800, in the Black Forest of
Ohio were typically cosmopolitan and had a significant
mission in forming, so far west as Lake
Erie and so far south as the lower Ohio, the
cosmopolitan American State par excellence.</p>

<p>But of all these early prompters&mdash;Symmes,
Cleaveland, Massie, and Putnam&mdash;the last is the
most lovable, and the movement he led is the
most significant and interesting. Our subject is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
so large in all its leading features, that the personality
of Putnam can only be touched upon.
As manager for the Ohio Company, a thousand
affairs of both great and trifling moment were
a part of his tiresome routine. Yet the heart of
the colony's leader was warm to the lowliest servant.
Many a poor tired voyager descending
the Ohio had cause to know that the founder
of Marietta was as good as a whole nation
knew he was brave. In matters concerning the
founding of the "Old Two-Horn," the first
church in the Old Northwest,&mdash;and in the organizing
of the little academy in the block-house
of the fort, to which Marietta College proudly
traces her founding, the private formative influence
of Putnam is seen to clear advantage.
Noble in a great crisis, he was noble still in the
lesser wearing duties of that pioneer colony of
which he was the hope and mainstay. Now
called upon by Washington to make the long
journey, in the dark days of 1792 after St.
Clair's terrible defeat, to represent the United
States in a treaty with the Illinois Indians on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
the Wabash; again, with sweet earnestness
settling a difficulty arising between a tippling
clergyman and his church; now, with absolute
fairness and generosity, criticising his brave but
high-strung governor for actions which he regarded
as too arbitrary, the character of Rufus
Putnam appeals more and more as a remarkable
example of that splendid simplicity which is the
proof and crown of greatness.</p>

<p>A yellow manuscript in Washington's handwriting
is preserved in the New York State
Library, which contains his private opinion of
the Revolutionary officers. It is such a paper
as Washington would not have left for the public
to read, as it expresses an inside view. Relatives
of a number of these Revolutionary heroes
would not read its simple sentences with pleasure,
but the descendants of Rufus Putnam may
remember it with pride: Putnam had not been
accused of securing certificates from his soldiers
by improper means; he was not, like Wayne,
"open to flattery&mdash;vain"; the odor of a whiskey
flask was not suggested by his name; on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
the contrary, "he possesses a strong mind and is
a discreet man." Considering the nature and
purpose of this high encomium, it is not less than
a hearty "Well done" to a good and faithful
servant.</p>

the centre of
the old Black
Forest of America,
near New
Philadelphia,
Ohio, a half-forgotten
Indian
graveyard lies
beside the dusty
country road.
You may count
here several
score of graves
by the slight mounds of earth that were raised
above them a century or so ago.</p>

<p>At one extremity of this plot of ground an
iron railing incloses another grave, marked by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
plain, marble slab, where rest the mortal remains
of a hero, the latchets of whose shoes few men
of his race have been worthy to unloose. And
those of us who hold duty a sacred trust, and
likeness unto the Nazarene the first and chiefest
duty, will do well to make the acquaintance of
this daring and faithful hero, whose very memory
throws over the darkest period of our history
the light that never was on sea or land.</p>

<p>The grave is that of David Zeisberger, the
Moravian missionary to the Indians in New York,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Canada for
fifty active years, who was buried at this spot
at his dying request, that he might await the
Resurrection among his faithful Indians. His
record is perhaps unequalled in point of length
of service, by the record of any missionary of
any church or sect in any land at any time.
Among stories of promotion and daring in early
America, this one is most unique and most
uplifting.</p>

<p>On a July night in 1726 a man and his wife
fled from their home in Austrian Moravia toward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
the mountains on the border of Saxony for conscience'
sake. They took with them nothing
save their five-year-old boy, who ran stumbling
between them, holding to their hands. The
family of three remained in Saxony ten years.
Then the parents emigrated to America, leaving
the son of fifteen years in Saxony to continue
his education. But within a year he took passage
for America and joined his parents in
Georgia, just previous to their removal to Bethlehem,
Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The lad soon became interested in the study
of the Delaware Indian language among the
natives of that tribe living along the Susquehanna,
and at once showed great proficiency.
Appreciating his talent, the fathers of the Moravian
Church determined to send the young
man to Europe, that in the best universities he
might secure the finest training. He went as
far as New York. There, just as his ship was
to sail, he pleaded with tears and on his knees
to be allowed to return to the woods of Pennsylvania
and the school of the red men there.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
The words of the wise were overcome by those
of the youth, and an earnest soul, as brave as
it was earnest, was saved to a life of unparalleled
sacrifice and devotion.</p>

<p>On returning to Bethlehem Zeisberger joined
a class that was studying the Mohawk tongue,
the language of that most powerful tribe of the
Iroquois nation which practically controlled, by
tomahawk and threat, all the territory between
the colonies and the Mississippi. Soon the
looked-for opportunity of visiting the Iroquois
land came, and the young student was told off
to accompany the heroic Frederick Christian
Post. This was in the dark year 1744, only a
few months previous to the outbreak of the Old
French War. The lad was now in his twenty-third
year.</p>

<p>In February of the next year, after these two
men entered the shadow of New York, the report
was circulated in New York City that two
spies had been captured among the Iroquois,
who were guilty of attempting to win that nation
over to the French. Such a charge at this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
time was the most serious imaginable, for the
contest for the friendship of the Iroquois between
the French on the St. Lawrence and the
English on the Atlantic was now of great importance.
Upon that friendship, and the support
it guaranteed, seemed to hang the destiny
of the continent. The report created endless
consternation, and the spies were hurried on to
Governor Clinton, who demanded that the
younger be brought before him instantly.</p>

<p>"Why do you go among the Indians?" asked
Clinton, savagely. It was David Zeisberger to
whom he spoke, a youth not daunted by arrogance
and bluster.</p>

<p>"To learn their language," he replied, calmly.</p>

<p>"And what use will you make of their
language?"</p>

<p>"We hope," replied the lad, "to get the
liberty to preach among the Indians the Gospel
of our crucified Saviour, and to declare to them
what we have personally experienced of His
grace in our hearts."</p>

<p>The Governor was taken aback. This was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
strange answer to have come from a spy's lips.
Yet he drove on rough-shod, taking it for
granted that the lad was lying, and that there
was an ulterior motive for the dangerous journey
at such a time. Remembering the fort the
English had built near the present site of Rome,
New York, and by which they hoped to command
the Mohawk Valley and the portage
path to Wood Creek and Lake Oneida, he
continued:</p>

<p>"You observed how many cannon were in Fort
William, and how many soldiers and Indians in
the castle?"</p>

<p>"I was not so much as in the fort, nor did I
count the soldiers or Indians."</p>

<p>Balked and angry, as well as nonplussed,
Governor Clinton insisted:</p>

<p>"Our laws require that all travellers in this
government of New York shall swear allegiance
to the King of England and have a license from
the Governor."</p>

<p>Governor Clinton's name would certainly not
adorn a license for these men. Whether or not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
the youth saw the trap, he was as frank as his
interrogator:</p>

<p>"I never before heard of such a law in
any country or kingdom in the world," replied
Zeisberger.</p>

<p>"Will you not take the oath?" roared Governor
Clinton, amazed.</p>

<p>"I will not," said the prisoner, and he was
straightway cast into a prison, where he and
his companion lay for six weeks, until freed by
an ordinance passed by Parliament exempting
the missionaries of the Moravian Church from
taking oath to the British crown.</p>

<p>Back into the Iroquois land journeyed the
liberated prisoner, and for ten doubtful years,
until 1755, Zeisberger was engaged in learning
the languages of the various tribes of the Six
Nations, and in active missionary service. His
success was very great. Perhaps in all the history
of these famous Indians there was no other
man, with the exception of Sir William Johnson,
whom they trusted as much as they trusted
David Zeisberger. Cheated on the one hand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
by the Dutch of New York, and robbed on the
other by agents of the French and the English,
the Iroquois became suspicious of all men; and
it is vastly more than a friendly compliment to
record that in his mission-house at Onondaga
they placed the entire archives of their nation,
comprising the most valuable collection of treaties
and letters from colonial governors ever made
by an Indian nation on this continent. But war
now drove the missionary away, as throughout
his life war was ever to dash his fondest dreams
and ever to drive him back.</p>

<p>At the close of the Old French War, the missionaries
of the Moravian Church were out again
upon the Indian trails that led to the North and
West. The first to start was Zeisberger, now
in the prime of life, forty-two years old. But
he did not turn northward. A call that he
could not ignore had come to him from the
friends of his boyhood days, the Delawares, who
lived now in Western Pennsylvania. With a
single companion he pushed outward to them.
Taking up his residence in what is now Bradford
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
County, Pennsylvania, he soon began to repeat
the successes he had achieved in the Iroquois
land, many being converted, and the whole
nation learning to love and trust the earnest
preacher. Then came Pontiac's terrible rebellion.
Compelled to hurry back to the settlements
again, Zeisberger awaited the end of
that bloody storm, which swept away every
fort in the West save only Fort Pitt and
Fort Detroit.</p>

<p>At last the way was again open, and Zeisberger
soon faced the wilderness. The Church
fathers now came to the conclusion that it was
best to extend missionary labor farther than ever
before. The entire West had been saved to
England, and the future was bright. It was
Zeisberger to whom they looked, and not for
a moment did the veteran flinch.</p>

<p>"Whither is the white man going?" asked an
old Seneca chieftain of Zeisberger.</p>

<p>"To the Alleghany River," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Why does the paleface travel such unknown
roads? This is no road for white
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
people, and no white man has come this trail
before."</p>

<p>"Seneca," said the pale man, "the business I
am on is different from that of other white men,
and the roads I travel are different too. I am
come to bring the Indian great and good words."</p>

<p>The work now begun in Potter County, and
later extended to Lawrence County, on the Beaver
River, in the province of Pennsylvania, was not
less successful than Zeisberger's work in New
York. "You are right," said the bravest Indian
of the nation to his Indian chieftain; "I have
joined the Moravians. Where they go I will
go; where they lodge I will lodge; their God
shall be my God." His faith was soon tested,
as was that of all Zeisberger's converts.</p>

<p>For there was yet a farther West. Beyond
the Beaver, the Delaware nation had spread
throughout the Black Forest that covered what
is now Ohio to the dots of prairie land on
the edge of what is Indiana. Somewhere here
the prairie fires had ceased their devastation.
Between the Wabash and the crest of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
Alleghanies lay the heaviest forest of the old
New World. Of its eastern half the Delawares
were now masters, with their capital at Goschgoschunk
on the Muskingum, the present Coshocton,
Ohio. The fame of Zeisberger had
come even here, and the grand council of the
Delawares sent him a call to bring his great and
good words into the Black Forest. It was an
irresistible appeal. Yet the Moravian Church
could not allow Zeisberger to leave the congregations
in Pennsylvania, for no one could take
his place. The brave man gave his answer
quickly: "I will take them with me."</p>

<p>He kept his word, and in the Spring of 1772
the heroic man could have been seen floating
down the Beaver and Ohio rivers with two
whole villages of Christian Indians, seeking a
new home in the Black Forest on the Upper
Muskingum. Here they founded three settlements
in all, SchÃ¶nbrunn (Beautiful Spring),
Lichtenau (Meadow of Light), GnadenhÃ¼tten
(Tents of Grace), where the fabled wanderer is
made by the poet to extend his search for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
Evangeline. Here the Moravian missionaries,
Zeisberger and his noble assistant, Heckewelder,
spent five marvellously successful years,
in what is known as the first settlements of
whites in the present State of Ohio, excepting
such French as had lived in the Lake region.
The settlements were governed by a complete
set of published laws, and in many respects
the experiment was an ideality fully achieved.
The good influence of the orderly and devout
colony spread throughout the Central West at
a time when every influence was bad and growing
rapidly worse. For five or six years Zeisberger
here saw the richest fruit of his life;
here also he was doomed to see what was undoubtedly
the most disgraceful and dastardly
crime ever committed in the name of freedom
on this continent.</p>

<p>The Revolutionary War now broke out, as
if to despoil wantonly this aged hero's last and
happiest triumph. The Moravians determined
upon the impossible role of neutrality, with
their settlements just beside the hard, wide
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
war-path which ran between Fort Pitt and
Fort Detroit; these were the strongholds, respectively,
of the Americans and the British,
who were quarrelling bitterly for the allegiance
of the savages in the Black Forest between
them. The policy was wholly disastrous. For
some time the Christian Indians, because the
influence of the past few years had been so
uplifting, escaped unharmed. But as the conflict
grew, bitter suspicion arose among both
the Americans in Western Pennsylvania and
the British at Sandusky and Detroit.</p>

<p>The British first took action. In 1781 three
hundred Indians under a British officer appeared
and ordered the inhabitants of the three villages
to leave the valley they loved and go to Sandusky,
where a stricter watch might be kept
over them. Like sheep they were driven northward,
the aged Zeisberger toiling at the head
of the broken-hearted company. As Winter
came down from the north, there being very
little food, a company of one hundred Christian
Indians obtained permission to return to their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
former homes to harvest corn which had been
left standing in the fields. It was an unfortunate
moment for the return, and the borderers on the
ravaged Pennsylvania frontier looked upon the
movement with suspicion. It is said that a party
of British Indians, returning from a Pennsylvania
raid, left here a sign of their bloody triumph. Be
that as it may, a posse of Americans suddenly
appeared on the scene. The entire company of
Moravian sufferers was surrounded and taken
captive. The question was raised, "Shall we
take our prisoners to Pittsburg, or kill them?"
The answer of the majority was, "Kill." The men
were hurried into one building and the women
into another, and the murderers went to work.</p>

<p>"My arm fails me," said one desperado, as
he knocked his fourteenth bound victim on the
head. "I think I have done pretty well. Go
on in the same way." And that night, as the
moon arose above the Tuscarawas, the wolves and
panthers fought in the moonlight for the bodies
of ninety Christian Indians most foully murdered.</p>

<p>Had each been his own child, the great grief
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
of the aged Zeisberger could not have been more
heartrending. After the storm had swept over
him and a shadow of the old peace came back to
his stricken heart, Zeisberger called his children
about him and offered a most patient prayer.</p>

<p>The record of Zeisberger's resolute faithfulness
to the remnant of his church from this time onward
is almost incredible. Like a Moses he led
them always, and first to a temporary home in
Macomb County, Michigan. From there they
were in four years driven by the Chippewas.
The forlorn pilgrims now set sail in two sloops
on Lake Erie; they took refuge from a terrible
storm in the mouth of the Cuyahoga River.
For a time they rested at a temporary home
in Independence Township, Cuyahoga County.
Famine drove them in turn from here. Setting
out on foot, Zeisberger led them next along the
shore of Lake Erie westward to the present site
of Milan, Erie County, Ohio. Here they resided
until the outbreak of the savage Indian
War of 1791. To escape from this, Zeisberger
secured from the British government a tract of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
land twelve miles long and six miles wide for
the Moravian Indians along the Grand River in
Canada. Here the pilgrims remained six years.
But with the close of the Indian War, it was
possible for them to return to their beloved
home in the Tuscarawas Valley. The United
States had given to the Moravian Church two
tracts of land here, embracing the sites of the
three towns formerly built, containing in all
twelve thousand acres.</p>

<p>Back to the old home the patriarch Zeisberger
brought his little company in the year 1798.
His first duty in the gloomy GnadenhÃ¼tten was
not forgotten. With a bowed head and heavy
heart the old man and one assistant gathered
from beneath the dense mass of bush and vine,
whither the wild beasts had carried them, the
bones of the ninety and more sacrificed Christians,
and over their present resting-place one of
the proudest of monuments now rises. For full
ten years more this hero labored in the shadow
of the forests where his happiest days had been
spent, and only as the Winter of 1808 came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
down upon the valley from the lakes did his
great heart cease beating and his spirit pass
through the heavenly gates.</p>

<p>The dust of this true hero lies, as he requested,
surrounded by the remains of those
"brown brethren" whom he led and loved so
long, when all the world reviled them and persecuted
them and said all manner of evil against
them falsely. In 1908 the memory of this man
will have blessed us for a full century. Shall
not a more appropriate token of our esteem replace
the little slab that now marks that hallowed
grave? And yet no monument can be
raised to the memory of David Zeisberger so
valuable or so significant as the little pile of his
own manuscripts collected by Edward Everett
and deposited by him under lock and key, in a
special case in the library of Harvard University.
Here are fourteen manuscripts, including a Delaware
Indian dictionary, a hymn book, a harmony
of the Gospels, a volume of litanies and
liturgies, and a volume of sermons to children.</p>

two miles
east of Charlottesville,
Virginia,
and more
than a mile
south of Thomas
Jefferson's famous
homestead,
Monticello, on a
sunny knoll by
the little Rivianna
River,
stood the humble
farmer's home in which George Rogers Clark
was born, November 19, 1752.</p>

<p>The baby's father and mother, John Clark and
Ann Rogers Clark, had moved into Albemarle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
County two years before from King-and-Queen
County, Virginia, where they had been married
in 1749. Their first child was born August 1,
1750, and was given his grandfather's name,
Jonathan; this second son was given the name
George Rogers, from one of his mother's
brothers&mdash;as though his parents had looked
with prophetic vision through the long years to
a time when the baby should become the idol
and savior of Kentucky, and had named him
from a Kentucky pioneer.</p>

<p>It was a busy farmer's home to which the
young child came and in which he received the
first hard lessons of life. His parents were
sturdy, hard-working people, like their ancestors
as far back as the records went, even to the first
John Clark, who came from England to Virginia
about the same time that the Puritans came to
Plymouth Rock, or to Giles Rogers, on his
mother's side, who also came from England at
very nearly the same time. Giles Rogers's son
John married Mary Byrd of the well-known
Virginian Byrd family, and George Rogers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
Clark's mother was the second daughter of that
union.</p>

<p>Who the boy's playmates may have been we
cannot know; his brother Jonathan was two
years his elder, and the two were probably comrades
together on the nursery floor and on the
green lawn before the farmhouse. When George
was three years of age his sister Ann was born;
and two years after that, in 1757, his brother
John was born. It has been said that George
Clark may have had Thomas Jefferson as a
playmate by the Rivianna, but there is some
doubt as to this, though the friendship of the
two in later life was undoubtedly warmer because
of the proximity of their boyhood homes.
George's father's land ran down and adjoined
that of Randolph Jefferson&mdash;Thomas Jefferson's
father. If the two boys who were to
become so famous met and played together it
was probably at the Jefferson Mill, where, it is
said, George Clark used to be sent with grist.
As the Clark family moved away from this
neighborhood in 1757, when George was only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
five years old, it does not seem likely that he
was sent to mill with grist very often.</p>

<p>Soon after John Clark, Jr., was born, George's
father and mother determined upon removing
from the Rivianna farm to land patented and
surveyed by Mrs. Clark's father in Caroline
County, Virginia, on the headwaters of York
River and just south of the upper Rappahannock.
So, late in the year 1757, we find the
father and mother and the four children, with
all their worldly possessions, on their eastward
journey to their new home. The Rivianna farm
had been sold for fifteen hundred dollars, and
the family can probably be said to have been in
comfortable circumstances for those days. None
of the four children were of an age to share in
the hardships of this removal, but for the two
eldest it must have been an epoch-making event.
Jonathan and George were old enough to enjoy
the novelty of the long journey,&mdash;-the scenes
along the busy roads, the taverns where all was
bustle and confusion, the villages with their shops
and stores, the cities where the children must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
have felt swallowed up in noise. But at last the
new home was reached, and the family was busily
at work preparing for the next year's crops.</p>

<p>Of the Caroline County home of the Clarks
we know little save the happy record of births
of children; yet this in itself gives us a large
picture of the merry household, its great joys,
and the host of little troubles which intensified
the gladness and hallowed it. Within three years
Richard Clark was born; Edmund was born
September 25, 1762; Lucy, September 15, 1765;
Elizabeth, February 11, 1768; William, August
1, 1770, his brother Jonathan's twentieth birthday;
and Frances, January 20, 1773. Jonathan
and George were soon old enough to be little
fathers to the younger children, and Ann must
have been able to help her mother to mend the
clothes for her rollicking brothers at a comparatively
early age; and I do not doubt for a
moment that there was a good deal of mending
to be done for these boys, for in later life we
know they loved adventure, and they must have
had many a boyish contest of strength and speed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
with little thought of how many stitches it would
take to make things whole again. This was a
fine farmer's family to look in at of a summer's
morning or a winter's night&mdash;just such a family
as old Virginia was to depend upon in the hard
days of the Revolution now drawing on apace.
And though you looked the Colonies through
from Northern Maine to Southern Georgia, you
could not have found by another fireside six boys
in one family who were to gain so much fame
in their country's service as these six. Jonathan
was one of the first men to enter the American
army, and he became a lieutenant-colonel with a
splendid record before the war was ended. His
brothers John and Edmund, and perhaps Richard,
were in the Revolutionary armies; all four
were recipients of Virginia bounty lands at the
close of the war. George Rogers Clark in the
meantime became the hero of the most famous
military expedition in Western history,&mdash;the
capture of Vincennes and its British fort and
Governor; and William, the next to the youngest
in that merry crowd of ten children, was to write
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
his name high on the pillar of fame as joint
leader of the memorable Lewis and Clark Expedition
through the Louisiana Territory to the
Pacific Ocean in 1804.</p>

<p>It was surely no accident that these lads grew
into daring, able men, for good blood will tell;
and Virginia in that day was giving the world
her richest treasures lavishly on the altar of
liberty. I know of no picture of the father of
these six boys; but the pictures of George and
William are remarkably similar, showing a strong
mark which must have come directly from one of
the grandfathers, either on the Clark or Rogers
side of the family. We may be sure Farmer
Clark and his wife exerted, a strong, wise influence
on their children, and Jonathan and George
were called upon at an early age to assist in the
management of the children, to settle disputes,
to tie up injured fingers, to reprimand, and to
praise. And in the school of the home and the
family circle these boys received the best and
about the only education they ever had; and it
would be well if many a boy nowadays would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
learn more in the home of patient, wise parents
and a little less from books.</p>

<p>The Clark boys, at least George Clark, would
have been benefited by a little more schooling in
books, especially a speller. It is quite sure that
George did not take full advantage of even the
few school privileges that he did have; but while
all his letters of later life are poorly spelled, that
may have been his principal weakness, and in
other branches he may have succeeded much
better; we know he did in one. For nine months
he was under the instruction of Donald Robertson,
under whom James Madison, afterwards
President of the United States, studied at about
the same time. Strangely enough this boy, who
would not learn to be careful with letters, became
proficient in the matter of figures and did well
in that most difficult of studies, mathematics.</p>

<p>In Clark's day a boy proficient in mathematics
did not have to look far for a profession
which was considered both honorable and lucrative,
and that was the surveyor's profession. It
was doubly enticing to a youth of brains and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
daring; the call for surveyors to go out into the
rich empire beyond the Alleghanies was loud and
continuous, and had been since Lord Fairfax
sent that young Virginia surveyor into the singing
forests of the Upper Potomac before the
outbreak of the Old French War; and from
George Washington down, you may count many
boys who went into the West as surveyors and
became the first men of the land. The surveyor
had many, if not all, the experiences of the soldier;
and every boy in Virginia envied the soldier
of the French War. The surveyor found the
good lands, and here and there surveyed a tract
for himself; this, in time, would become of great
value. The surveyor knew the Indians and their
trails; he knew where the best hunting-grounds
and salt-licks were located; he knew where the
swamps lay, and the fever-fogs that clung to
them; he knew the rivers, their best fishing-pools,
and how far up and down they were navigable;
he was acquainted with everything a man would
wish to know, and he knew of things which
every man wished to escape,&mdash;floods, famines,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
skulking redskins, fevers. For these reasons the
surveyors became the men needed by generals
to guide the armies, by the great land-companies
to point out right fields for speculation, by transportation
companies and quartermasters and
traders to designate the best paths to follow
through the black forests. The tried, experienced
surveyor was in an admirable position to secure a
comfortable fortune for his labor. While Washington
(the largest landholder in America in
Clark's day&mdash;and half his lands in the West)
selected in person much of his own land, yet, as
we have seen, the time came when he employed
William Crawford to find new lands for him.</p>

<p>Perhaps young Clark came but slowly to a
realization that he could enter the fine profession
of a surveyor; but when the time came to decide
he seized upon the opportunity and the opening
with utmost enthusiasm and energy. Both of
his grandfathers had been surveyors to a greater
or less extent; possibly their old instruments
were in his father's possession. If so, these were
taken out and dusted, and the boy was set to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
work surveying, probably, his father's farm. Its
dimensions were well known, and the boy could
be sure of the accuracy or inaccuracy of his
experiments. In time George probably was
called upon to do odd pieces of surveying in the
neighborhood in which he lived; thus the days
and the years went by, each one fitting the lad
for his splendid part on the world's stage of
action. The first act in the drama was Clark's
introduction to the West&mdash;the land of which he
had so often dreamed, and which he now in his
twentieth year went to see.</p>

<p>We cannot be sure just when young Clark set
out from his home, but we find him in the little
town of Pittsburg early in the summer of 1772,
and we can well suppose he made the long trip
over Braddock's Road from Virginia with some
friends or neighbors from Caroline County, with
whom he joined himself for the purpose of looking
at the land of which he had heard so much,
and possibly picking out a little tract of land
in the Ohio Valley for himself. As a surveyor
of some experience he was in a position to offer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
his services to any one desiring them, and thus
turn an honest penny in the meantime.</p>

<p>Of the wars and bloody skirmishes fought
around this town every Virginia boy had heard;
through all of George Rogers Clark's youth
great questions were being debated here in these
sunny Alleghany meadows or in the shadowy
forests&mdash;and the arguments were of iron and
lead. The French had come down the rivers
from the Great Lakes to seize the Ohio Valley;
the colonists had pushed slowly across the Alleghanies
to occupy the same splendid land. Nothing
but war could have settled such a bitter
quarrel; and, as the Clark boy now looked for
the first time upon the relics of those small but
savage battles, his heart no doubt warmed to his
Virginian patriots who had saved the West to
America. How little did the lad know that there
was another savage war to be fought for this
Ohio Valley, and that he himself was to be its
hero!</p>

<p>All along the route to Pittsburg the boy and
his comrades, whoever they may have been, kept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
their eyes open for good farm sites; perhaps
they were surprised to find that all the land
beside and adjacent to Braddock's Road was
already "taken up." Washington himself had
acquired that two-hundred-and-thirty-two-acre
tract in Great Meadows where Fort Necessity
stood; not far from Stewart's Crossing (Connellsville,
Pa.) Washington had the other piece
of land with the mill on it. Everywhere Clark
went in the West he found land which had
been taken up by the shrewd Mount Vernon
farmer or his agents. I do not believe Clark
begrudged Washington a single acre, but was,
on the other hand, pleased to know that the
Colonel was to receive some good return for all
his hard campaigning in the West in addition to
his paltry pay as an officer.</p>

<p>Clark passed as a young gentleman among the
strange, rough populace of infant Pittsburg,
where fighting, drinking, and quarrelling were
going on in every public place; I can see the
boy as he went about the rude town and listened
to the talk of the traders and the loungers who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
filled the taverns and stores. It might have been
at this time that the boy first began to satisfy an
honest thirst with dishonest liquids, which would
in time become his worst enemy and sadly dull
the lustre of as bright a name as any man could
win. Of course we must remember that at that
day it was highly polite and gentlemanly to take
an "eye-opener" every morning and a "night-cap"
every night, and drink the health of friends
often between times; yet no young man but was
injured by this awakening of an unknown craving,
and, in the case of our hero, it was to prove
a craving that would cost him almost all the great
honors that he should win.</p>

<p>The lad looked with wide-open eyes, no doubt,
at the remains of old Fort Duquesne, where
many brave Virginians had lost their lives; for
many had been fiendishly put to death by savages
driven to bitter hatred by French taunts and
made inhuman by French brandy. He must have
been greatly interested in little Fort Pitt, which
had withstood the wild attacks of Pontiac's most
desperate hell-hounds of war, the Shawnees.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
Here, if anywhere on the continent, men had
been brave; here, if anywhere, men had dropped
into deathless graves. He was greatly interested
in the future, though the ringing notes of the
past must have stirred his heart deeply; and I
can see the lad with bended head listening to
catch every word of a speaker who would talk
of the present feeling of the dreaded Shawnees,
who refused to acknowledge that the Six Nations
had any right to sell to white men their
fine hunting-grounds between the Ohio and the
Tennessee.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Rev. David Jones</span><br />
    <i>Companion of George Rogers Clark</i></div>
</div>

<p>When we hear directly of Clark in Pittsburg
he was in admirably good company and well
spoken of; he had fallen in with the Rev. David
Jones, the enterprising Baptist missionary from
New Jersey, who had come into the West on
a joint mission concerning both the possibilities
of missionary service among the Shawnees
on the Scioto, and Franklin's proposed settlement
on the eastern bank of the Ohio River.
He was, therefore, a prospector for land and for
missionary openings&mdash;a good man for the lad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Clark to know. Mr. Jones was thirty-six years
of age, enthusiastic and brave, or he would not
have been on the Ohio in 1772. He was old
enough to remember well the story of the Old
French War, as well as Pontiac's Rebellion, and
the story of the West from that day down. Of
this, no doubt, the two talked freely. Mr. Jones
kept a diary, and his record for Tuesday, June 9,
reads: "... Left Fort Pitt in company with
Mr. George Rogers Clark, and several others,
who were disposed to make a tour through this
new world." Gliding on down the Ohio, the
canoe and its adventurous pilgrims were glad to
get safely by the Mingo town near Steubenville,
Ohio, whose Indian inhabitants (remnants of the
Iroquois Indians, in the West known as Mingoes)
were desperate savages, canoe plundering
being the least harm that might be expected from
them. Farther down, at the mouth of Grave
Creek, near where Wheeling, West Virginia, now
stands, the party camped; here Mr. Jones's interpreter,
David Owens, joined them, having come
across country from the Monongahela River.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
This spot was to become an important point on
the Upper Ohio; it was to become well known to
the young adventurer, who now looked upon it
for the first time; it was soon to become his first
home in the West. But for the present he went
on with Mr. Jones. The party proceeded as far
down as the mouth of the Little Kanawha River,
where Parkersburg, West Virginia, now stands.
Returning up the river June 24, they reached
Grave Creek within two weeks; the party, including
at least Higgins and the interpreter
Owens together with Jones and Clark, started
on an overland trip to the Monongahela. Jones
records:</p>

<p class="bq">"... Therefore moved up to Grave Creek, leaving
there our canoes; crossed the desert (wilderness) to
Ten Mile Creek, which empties into [the] Monongahela....
The season was very warm; all except
myself had loads to carry, so that on the 2d day of
July, with much fatigue we arrived to the inhabitants
[at the settlements], faint, weak, weary, and hungry&mdash;especially
Mr. Clark and myself."</p>

<p>The size of the settlement can be judged from
the fact that on the second Sunday of Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
Jones's stay on George's Creek he preached to
a congregation of about two hundred.</p>

<p>On July 14 the four travellers set out again
overland for Fort Pitt. They reached the fort
on Wednesday, July 22, and the Virginia boy
was probably glad to leave the forests and the
river for a while and rest quietly in the little
village of Pittsburg. For one thing, he had
some letters to write, and we can imagine how
anxious the friends at home were to hear from
him. Would he like the country? Would he
wish to stay in the West? Would he want the
other members of the family to emigrate there
too? These were some of the questions his
parents and brothers and sisters were asking in
the old home in Caroline County as the summer
days went by. We are certain that Clark was
immensely pleased with all he had seen; whether
it was pushing a canoe down the rivers, or sleeping
on a river's shore with the water babbling
beside him, or carrying a pack over the "blind"
trails of the old Southwest, he loved the land,
its freshness, the freedom of its forests, the air
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
of hope and adventure which pervaded everything
and everybody. All this appealed to him
and fascinated him.</p>

<p>After a good rest he hurried on home in the
wake of his glowing letters, to enforce them, and
if possible to induce the home people to come
quickly to obtain the good lands before they were
all taken. Before he went it is probable that he
entered his claim for a piece of land on the Ohio
near the mouth of Fish Creek, some thirty miles
below the present site of Wheeling. How interesting
must have been that home-coming!
What a fine picture that would be, if we could see
the young lad, who was to be the hero of the West,
sitting before his father's doorstep, describing
to a silent audience of relatives and neighbors the
grandeur and greatness of the West, the crowds
of immigrants, the growing villages, the conflicts
between the white and the red men! Perhaps
he drew a rough map of the Ohio in the
sand at the foot of the front doorsteps, showing
where his claim was located, and where Washington's
rich tracts were located. Then he told of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
the Ohio, its islands and its fierce eddies, of the
Indian trails that wound along on the "hog-backs"
from settlement to settlement, of the
great mounds which the ancient giants (as people
once thought the mound-building Indians were)
built beside the Ohio. And then at last he told
of his purpose to return and live in that country
and grow up with it.</p>

<p>The records of the next few years were very
much confused. Young Clark visited various
portions of the West, perhaps remaining longest
at a claim he took up near the mouth of Grave
Creek, on the present site of Moundsville, West
Virginia, from which point he addressed letters
to his brother Jonathan, January 9, 1773. In
the Spring of the next year he formed one of
Captain Cressap's party assembled at Wheeling
in readiness for service in Dunmore's War. In
this war Clark saw considerable service, following
Dunmore's wing of the army, but not participating
in the battle at Point Pleasant, which was
fought by General Lewis. In the Spring of the
year following, 1775, we find Clark returning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
again to his original mission in the West,&mdash;that
of surveying land and securing tracts for himself.
"I have engaged," he wrote his brother
Jonathan from Stewart's Crossing, "as a deputy
surveyor under Cap'n Hancock Lee, for to lay
out lands on ye Kentuck, for ye Ohio company,
at ye rate of 80Â£ pr. year, and ye privilege of
taking what land I want." Midsummer found
him at Leestown, a mile below Frankfort, seventy
miles up the Kentucky River, where he said
fifty families would be living by Christmas time.
The public, however, needed the service of the
young man, and it is plain that his experience
in the war had been serviceable, for he was made
commander of the scattered militia of Kentucky.
During the next Winter, however, we find him
again in Virginia; it is probable that his constant
moving about had brought advantages, though
his private affairs may have suffered more or less
from neglect. The Spring of the next year he
was back in Kentucky, and soon, in no uncertain
way, the leader of the busy swarms of pioneers.
"He was brave, energetic, bold," writes William
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
H. English, "prepossessing in appearance, of
pleasing manners, and in fact with all the qualities
calculated to win from a frontier people.
The unorganized and chaotic condition of the
company needed such a man, and the man had
come."</p>

<p>It is interesting to notice the conflict which
was precipitated between Clark as leader of the
pioneers and Richard Henderson's Transylvania
Company, and a pleasure to note that Clark
never seemed to speak or act in a vindictive way
with reference to Henderson's questionable purchase;
in fact he wrote to his brother in 1775:</p>

<p class="bq">"Colonel Henderson is here and claims all ye country
below Kentucke. If his claim should be good, land may
be got reasonable enough, and as good as any in ye
world. My father talked of seeing this land in August.
I shall not advise him whether to come or not; but I am
convinced that if he once sees ye country he will never
rest until he gets on it to live. I am ingrossing all ye
land I possibly can, expecting him."</p>

<p>It is plain from this quotation that Richard
Henderson was the friend of the Kentucky
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
pioneer. But there was a very important question
to be settled immediately; did Kentucky
belong to Virginia or was it independent? What
was its political status? It was decided to get at
the facts of the case, and Clark was instrumental
before all others in calling a mass meeting of
Kentucky pioneers at Harrodstown, June 6,
1776, where he expected that two or more
"agents" would be selected by the people with
general power to consult Virginia as to the legal
status of "Transylvania." Clark arrived late at
this meeting, and on arrival found that he himself,
and John Gabriel Jones, had been selected,
not as agents, but as actual "members of the
Virginia Legislature," to represent a County of
Kentucky. The Transylvania Company had
performed its important mission, and Richard
Henderson was reimbursed for any losses incurred.
George Rogers Clark now steps into
the position occupied by Henderson as the leader
and sustainer of the Kentucky movement.</p>

<p>The brilliancy of Clark's military leadership
during the next few years, while he was effecting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
a conquest of Illinois, has entirely put into shade
the genuine influence and merit of his service
previously rendered. No herald of empire in
the Middle West who was especially prominent
in military affairs did more to accelerate and
assure the victory of the army of axe-bearing
pioneers than did George Rogers Clark in these
critical years, 1775, 1776, and 1777. He fell
heir, though a mere boy, to a day's responsibility
and taxing toils relinquished by Richard Henderson;
and it would not be too much to say,
perhaps, that were we to omit the humble, less
spectacular services that were performed in these
three years, or the renowned service heroically
performed in 1778 and 1779, the nation could
more easily spare those of the later period. But
as Clark now went eastward as a delegate to the
Virginia Legislature, he appreciated more and
more that the danger of Kentucky lay in the two
British forts at Kaskaskia and Vincennes; not
because of the proximity of the troops there
located, but because of the baneful influence
exerted upon all the neighboring Indian tribes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
by English officers and American renegades who
occupied them. The campaign in Illinois, prosecuted
with so much brilliancy and renown, had
for its vital motive not the conquest of thousands
of forest-strewn miles of wilderness, but rather
the salvation of the pioneer settlers in <i>Ken-ta-kee</i>.
Any other view of the matter would be a
serious error.</p>

<p>The proud city of Louisville dates its founding
from Clark's famous Illinois campaign, for
while descending the Ohio River he left some
twenty families on Corn Island, May 27, 1778,
who were the first of their race to make a permanent
home within the sound of the chattering
waters of the historic Falls of Ohio, first visited
by La Salle over a hundred years before. In
less than a year the settlement was moved to the
Kentucky shore, and a fort was built at the foot
of what is now Twelfth Street, in what was then
the town of Falls of Ohio, the present Louisville.
General Clark may be justly called the founder
of that city, as it was his decision that made
"The Falls" the rendezvous and metropolis of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
the Lower Ohio. "This action," writes Mr. English,
"and the security given by the forts he
caused to be built there, attracted the first settlers
and fixed the future destiny of Louisville, Jeffersonville,
and New Albany.... Clark undoubtedly
gave the matter much thought, and looked
far into the future in making this selection. He
expected two great cities to arise some day at the
Falls; first Louisville, to be followed later, as
the country became populous, by one on the
other side of the river, which he hoped would
bear his name. But, until Virginia made the
grant for Clarksville, the plan of what he expected
would be a great city at Louisville absorbed
his attention." One of his first acts was
to draw a map of the future city, marking the
public and private divisions of land as he would
have had them located; in this plan he left a
number of vacant spaces for public parks, and it
is one of the vain regrets of the citizens of the
present city that the plan of General Clark in this
respect could not have been remembered.</p>

<p>It is important to notice that Clark believed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
that the best way to maintain the conquest of
Illinois was by inducing immigration to the
Lower Ohio and the building up of a strong
pioneer colony, not in Illinois, but along the
river. "Our only chance at present," he wrote
to Colonel John Todd, the Governor of Illinois
County, "to save that country is by encouraging
the families; but I am sensible nothing but land
will do it. I should be exceedingly cautious in
doing anything that would displease the Government
[Virginia], but their present interest, in
many respects obvious to us here, calls so loudly
for it, that I think, sir, that you might even venture
to give a deed for forty or fifty thousand
acres of land at said place at the price that Government
may demand for it."</p>

<p>The place referred to here is not Louisville,
but near the mouth of the Ohio River. In fact
it is very plain from many sources that Clark was
the prime mover in the settlement of the Lower
Ohio up to the year 1783, when he was wantonly
and ignominiously turned adrift by the State of
Virginia, which then owed him thirty thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
dollars, with only four shillings in its treasury.
The latter portion of Clark's life is not one which
we are proud to remember, but he never sank so
low that the nation has been able to forget his
brilliant and persistent courage. There was
ground for his bitter cry: "I have given the
United States half the territory they possess,
and for them to suffer me to remain in poverty,
in consequence of it, will not redound much to
their honor." It is little comfort that nearly
thirteen years after his death the sum justly
owed to the man was paid to his heirs. The
memory of Clark's leadership of the army that
bore the sword is a precious inheritance; the
facts respecting his equally important enthusiasm
and earnestness in leading the scattered cohorts
of the army bearing the broadaxe should likewise
have a place in history.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">I<span class="smcap">t</span>
may be said
without fear
of contradiction
that the subject
of the Panama
and Nicaragua
canals has not
received more
popular attention
in this day
and generation
than our first
and greatest national
highway&mdash;legally known as the Cumberland
Road, from its starting point&mdash;received
in the first generation of the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>For it was clear to the blindest that the great
empire west of the Alleghanies, of which Washington
dreamed and planned, where Zeisberger
labored and built the first home, and to which
brave Henderson and Putnam led their colonies
of patriots, must soon be bound to the Union by
something stronger than Indian trails. France
and England had owned this West and lost it;
could the little Republic born in the fierce fires
of 1775 hold what they&mdash;proud kingdoms&mdash;had
lost? Could it mock the European doctrine that,
in time, mountains inevitably become boundaries
of empires? Those little States of which Berkeley
sang, placed by the hand of God as rebukes
to lustful and universal dominion&mdash;were they
needed in the destinies of America? Such questions
were asked freely in those hard days which
succeeded the Revolution. Then the whole world
looked upon the East and the West as realms as
distinct as Italy and France, and for the same
geographical reason. England and Spain had
their vast "spheres of influence" marked out as
plainly in America then as Germany and France
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
and Russia have theirs marked in the China of to-day.
Kentucky became a hotbed of foreign emissaries,
and the whirl of politics in that pivotal
region a decade after the Revolution will daunt
even the student of modern Kentucky politics.
So patriotic and so faithful is that eastern West
to-day that it is difficult to believe by what a
fragile thread it hung to the trembling Republic
on the Atlantic slope&mdash;"one nation to-day,
thirteen to-morrow"&mdash;in those black days when
Wilkinson and Burr and even George Rogers
Clark "played fast and loose with conspiracy."</p>

<p>The Indian trails were the threads which first
bound the East and the West. Soon a large
number of these threads were twisted, so to
speak, into a few cords&mdash;hard, rough pioneer
roadways which wound in and out among the
great trees and morasses in the forest shades.
Then came a few great, well-built (for their
day) roadways which meant as much commercially
and politically, in their age, as the steel
hawsers which in our time have bound and
welded a great people so closely together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>The greatest of these old-time highways was
that wide avenue opened from Cumberland,
Maryland, through Pennsylvania, the "Panhandle,"
and on across Ohio, between 1806 and
1840. It is popularly known as the Old National
Road; its legal name was the Cumberland Road.
It was the logical result of Washington's cherished
plan of binding the trans-Alleghany region
firmly to the East. It was largely promoted by
Albert Gallatin, who in 1806 made a report, as
Secretary of the Treasury, strongly urging such
works of internal improvement. But its best
friend and stanchest champion was Henry Clay;
and beside it stands to-day a monument to his
memory near the little hamlet which bears his
name&mdash;Claysville, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>This great road was born in the Act of Congress
of 1802, which enabled the State of Ohio
to enter the Union. Section VII of that act decreed
that the money received from the sale of
one-twentieth of the public lands in Ohio should
be applied to building roads from the navigable
waters of Atlantic streams to and within the new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
State "under the authority of Congress." The
matter was put in charge of the War Department,
and soon commissioners appointed by the
President of the United States were surveying
a route for a national road from East to West.
The first government appropriation was dated
1806, and was thirty thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Words cannot describe the intense wave of
enthusiasm which swept over the West when it
was known that this mighty new power in Western
life was actually to come into existence.
Our government never carried out a more timely
or popular measure, for it was as timely as it was
popular. When the Revolutionary War was
over, a great stream of immigration poured into
the West, but the Indian War of 1790-95 severely
checked it. With the treaty of Greenville the
great social movement again began, and the War
of 1812, in turn, again interfered to postpone the
genuine settlement of the old Northwest. This
national road was begun at Cumberland, Maryland,
in 1811, and, even in the dark days of
the war, was slowly pushed along over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
Alleghanies by way of Uniontown and Washington,
Pennsylvania, toward Wheeling on the Ohio
River. When the war was over it was nearing its
destination, and in 1818 was open for traffic to
the Ohio.</p>

<p>If studied closely, the last three years of the
second decade of the nineteenth century are
fascinating years to a student of our national expansion.
The beginning of successful steam navigation
on the Ohio and its tributaries, and the
completion of the Cumberland National Road to
the Ohio, were largely responsible for this. Such
impressive material advances, coming at the time
when both Great Britain and the Indians had been
effectually disposed of (so far as national growth
was concerned), gave enthusiasm to the eager
spirit of the time. Great deeds were proposed;
great economic questions began to be faced and
fought out as never before. The many-sided
question of internal improvements, the beginning
of the Erie Canal, the opening of the Lehigh coal
fields, the problem of applying the power of
steam to vehicles as well as vessels, the difficult
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
problem solved later by the Missouri Compromise,
and the one involved in Birkbeck's English
Prairie settlement in Illinois, the problem of
steam navigation on the Great Lakes,&mdash;all these
and many more like them were the topics of the
hour when this Cumberland Road, the first of all
our great feats of improvement, reached and then
threw itself across the Ohio River. Measured by
the hopes it inspired and not by miles, judged by
the power it was expected to exert in national
life and not by the ruins that now mark its
ancient track, this road from the Potomac to
the Mississippi must be considered a most significant
monument to those wild but splendid
years when as a people we were first facing some
of the most fundamental questions of existence.
There comes in every boy's life a period when
he shoots suddenly out and up to the stature of
a man. Young America sprang up like that in
those momentous years.</p>

<p>Nearly a score of years before the Cumberland
Road was built, the first macadamized road
in the United States, the Lancaster Turnpike,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
was constructed by a private company between
Philadelphia and Lancaster, Pennsylvania.
Pennsylvania had macadamized portions of her
highway across the mountains by way of Chambersburg
and Bedford to Pittsburg. But on
no highway was the principle of macadamization
carried so far as on the Cumberland Road.
The cost was found to be prodigious. Between
Cumberland, Maryland, and Uniontown,
Pennsylvania, it was $9745 per mile instead
of $6000, which the commissioners estimated,
without bridging. Between Uniontown and
Wheeling the cost ran up to the startling average
of about $13,000 per mile&mdash;within $800 of
the estimated cost per mile of the Erie Canal.
Too liberal contracts accounted, in part, at least,
for this extravagance. The stones used were
reduced to four ounces each and spread in three
layers, traffic being permitted for a time over
each layer in succession. No covering was laid
until these layers had become comparatively solid.
Catch-water drains, with a gradual curvature,
were located at proper distances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>Several of the officers in charge of the work
stand high in the estimation of their countrymen.
There was McKee, who fell at Buena
Vista, and Williams, who gave his life to his
country at Monterey; there were Gratiot, Delafield,
Bliss, Bartlett, Hartzell, Colquit, Cass,
Vance, Pickell; and there was Mansfield, who, as
major-general, fell at Antietam. Among the
names in one of the surveying corps is recorded
that of Joseph E. Johnston.</p>

<p>This national road rested legally upon an
interpretation of the Constitution held by those
who favored internal improvement as a means
of investing the Government's surplus. A great
plan had been outlined in 1806 by Albert Gallatin,
then Secretary of the Treasury. The Constitution
gives the Government the right to
regulate post-roads and the mails. This implied
the right, the promoters of internal improvement
argued, to build roads, with the sanction of
the States through which such roads passed.
There were those who opposed the theory, and
even from the very beginning there was strong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
opposition by strict constructionists to the road
appropriations. The very first vote on the first
appropriation was 66 to 50, showing that at the
start there was almost an even division on the legality
of the question. The opposition increased
as greater and still greater sums were asked of the
Treasury each year. Three hundred thousand
dollars was asked in 1816, and more in 1818.
In the next year the tremendous amount of
$535,000 was asked for and voted. It is little
wonder that Congress was staggered by the
amount of money absorbed by this one road.
What if other national roads proposed&mdash;through
the South and northward from Washington to
Buffalo&mdash;should demand equally large sums?
It was easily to be seen that the entire revenue
of the Government could readily be spent in filling
up the bog-holes of American roads with
limestone.</p>


<div class="figcenter bord"><a name="illo_205.jpg" id="illo_205.jpg"></a>
  <img src="images/illo_205.jpg" width="492" height="600"
      alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Albert Gallatin</span><br />
    <i>Promoter of the Cumberland Road</i></div>
</div>

<p>Yet the policy of internal improvements was
a popular one, advocated by politicians and applauded
by the people; and every year, despite
the same Constitutional arguments advanced,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
and though at times the opposing forces had
their way, the Cumberland Road bills came back
for reconsideration, and were at last passed.</p>

<p>But it finally appeared that the matter of getting
the road repaired when once it was built
was a more serious question than the mere building
problem. Members of Congress who had
been persuaded to give their vote for the initial
expense bolted outright on voting money each
year to extend the road farther westward and
also repair the portions already built. The matter
was precipitated in 1822, when a bill was
presented to the House and Senate providing
that toll-gates be erected and that the Government
should charge travellers for the use of the
road. The bill passed both branches of Congress,
but it was vetoed immediately by President
Monroe on the ground that the national Government
could not collect toll unless, as sovereign,
it owned the ground that the road occupied.
This was an interesting question, and one of great
importance, bringing as it did upon Congress
an earnest discussion bordering on the intricate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
problem of States Rights. Mr. Clay urged that
if the Government had a right to build the road
it had the right to preserve it from falling into
decay. Of course there was now, as always, a
strong opposition to the road on the general
ground of Constitutionality; but those who were
aware that their objections to the road would be
overruled by the majority, in any event, took the
consistent ground that if they could not prevent
the enactments of laws they could, by passing
laws creating toll-gates, relieve the Government
at least from the expense of repairing the road.</p>

<p>As President Monroe, however, did not agree
with or believe in the original right to build the
road, he was compelled to deny the Government's
right to charge toll on roads in the various States.
He outlined his conclusions and returned the bill
vetoed.</p>

<p>A cry which shook the country went up from
the West. In the act which admitted Ohio to the
Union, five per cent of money received from the
sale of lands was, as before noted, to be applied
by the Government to the building of roads to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
and in the West. Of this five per cent, three was
to be devoted to building roads within the State
of Ohio, and two per cent toward the expense of
building a road from Atlantic tide-water to Ohio,
according to a supplementary law passed March
3, 1803. By allowing the Cumberland Road to
stop at Ohio's eastern boundary, the Government
was "breaking faith" with the West. This
must not be, and therefore in 1824 President
Monroe found an excuse to sign another Cumberland
Road bill. The technicality honestly
raised by Monroe was against the spirit of the
times and the genius of the age. Legal technicalities
were put aside, and the great road swept
on westward; it was ordered to be projected
through the capitals of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois
to Jefferson, Missouri. It reached Columbus
in 1833, and Indianapolis about 1840. It was
graded to Vandalia, then the capital of Illinois,
and marked out to Jefferson, Missouri, but was
never completed under national auspices.</p>

<p>It is to be observed that the Cumberland Road
went forward largely because of the compact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
between the State of Ohio and the national Government.
Knowing, as we now do, that the road
was one of the most important material items in
our national growth, it must seem fortunate
from any point of view that the Ohio compact
was made when and as it was. By its terms the
Government was to build a road with the money
accruing from a certain source. The originators
of the compact seemed to have no real knowledge
of the questions at issue, either concerning the
amount of money needed for the purpose of
building the road from tide-water to the Ohio
River, or of the amount that was likely to accrue
from the source indicated. What if the fund
produced from the sales of land was not sufficient
to build the road? For some time the appropriations
were made on the theory that the
money would eventually come back into the treasury
from the land sales; but it soon became plain
that there was not a hope left that even fifty per
cent of the amount expended would return from
the expected source.</p>

<p>When this fact became patent, the friends of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
the road were put to their utmost to maintain its
cause; some interesting points were raised that
could not but weigh heavily with men of generous
good sense, such as this: surveys had been
made outlining the course of the road far in
advance of the portion that was being actually
built, and some of the States were planning all
their roads with reference to this great Appian
Way that was to be the main highway across the
continent. Large preparations had been made
here and there along the proposed route by those
owning property, in the way of building taverns
and road houses, not to speak of villages that
sprang up in a night at points where it seemed
certain the road would meet important branch
roads. Throughout the years when the Cumberland
Road bills were under discussion it is of particular
interest to note how men were influenced
by the greater, more fundamental human arguments,
rather than by mere technical or legal
points. Of course the Western members were
without a dissenting voice in favor of the road.
And when Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
successively admitted to the Union, a similar provision
concerning the sale of public lands and
road-building was inserted as in the case of Ohio;
and though it is not clear that any one believed
the source of income was equal to the object to
be benefited, yet the magnanimous legislation
went on without a pause through the twenties
and into the thirties. In the Senate, for instance,
the opposition to the road bills could usually
depend on two solid votes from North Carolina,
South Carolina, Virginia, and New York; and
one vote, ordinarily, from Maine, Connecticut,
New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Tennessee,
and Alabama. On minor points other votes
could be temporarily secured, but on the main
question there was always a safe majority in
favor of the enterprise. However, it is plain
the opposition to the road was sectional only in
the sense that it came from the States not to be
directly benefited. Though two or more New
England votes could be depended upon in the
Senate to be thrown against a Cumberland Road
bill, yet such a man as Edward Everett said in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
an address at Lexington, Kentucky, in 1829:
"The State of which I am a citizen [Massachusetts]
has already paid between one and two thousand
dollars toward the construction and repair
of that road; and I doubt not she is prepared to
contribute her proportion toward its extension
to the place of its destination." But, it must be
remembered, Everett was one who caught as few
others did the spirit of our genius for expansion,
the man who in 1835 uttered the marvellous
words: "Intercourse between the mighty interior
West and the seacoast is the great principle
of our commercial prosperity."</p>

<p>If there is one practical lesson in all the peculiar
history of the one national road that America
built (for the others proposed were never constructed),
it is with reference to the repairing of
the road. At first it seemed that the great question
was merely to obtain funds for the first cost
of making the road. But it soon appeared that
the far greater question was to operate and repair
the road; it was well enough that the Government
build the road, seemingly, but it was early
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
realized that a local power must control the road
and see to its repairs, or an enormous waste of
public money would result. The experience of
those years brought home the lesson that the
problem of maintenance and operation is far
more serious than the problem of original cost.</p>

<p>The objection raised to the Government's
erecting toll-gates and collecting tolls, as implying
sovereignty over the land occupied by the
road, was at last silenced by allowing each State
through which the road passed to accept it from
the Government as fast as it was completed, and
to take charge of its operation and control.
Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Ohio
accepted completed portions between 1831 and
1834. Toll-gates were immediately erected by
State authorities, and tolls collected. From her
twelve toll-gates Pennsylvania received over
$37,000 in the twenty months following May
1, 1843. In the most prosperous year in
Ohio, 1839, the treasurer of that State received
$62,496.10 from the National Road tolls. What
per cent received by toll-gate keepers was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
actually turned in cannot be discussed, as those
were the "good old days." Each toll-gate keeper,
it must be observed, retained two hundred dollars
per annum as salary, and five per cent of all
receipts above one thousand dollars at this time.
This fast and loose system was the means of discovering
some great rascals. Between 1831 and
1877 Ohio received $1,139,795.30 from the Cumberland
Road in tolls.</p>

<p>These sober statistics give only a hint of those
gay, picturesque days when this highway was a
teeming thoroughfare, lined with towns of national
importance that are now forgotten, and
with thousands of taverns and road-houses, even
the foundation-stones of which have vanished
from the old-time sites. Great stagecoach lines
operated here, known as widely in their day as
the railways are now, their proprietors boasting
over rival lines in points of speed, safety, and
appointments. The largest company on the
Cumberland Road was the National Road
Stage Company, with headquarters at Uniontown,
Pennsylvania. The Ohio National Stage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
Company was the most important west of the
Ohio River. There were the "Good Intent" line,
and the "Landlords," "Pioneer," "June Bug,"
and "Pilot" lines. Fine coaches bore names
as aristocratic as our Pullman cars do to-day.
There were "trusts" and "combinations," quarrels
and lawsuits, worthy of the pen of any
sensational magazine-writer or novelist.</p>

<p>The advertisement of an "opposition" stagecoach
line of 1837 is of interest on several
accounts:</p>

<div class="bq">
<p class="center">OPPOSITION!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Defiance Fast Line Coaches</span></p>

<p class="center">DAILY</p>

Columbus, Springfield, and intermediate points.</p>

<p class="center font-smaller">Through in less time than any other line.<br />
"<i>By opposition the people are well served.</i>"</p>

<p>The Defiance Fast Line connects at Wheeling, Va.,
with Reside &amp; Co.'s Two Superior daily lines to Baltimore,
McNair and Co.'s Mail Coach line, via Bedford,
Chambersburg, and the Columbia and Harrisburg
Rail Roads to Philadelphia being the only direct line
from Wheeling&mdash;: also with the only coach line from</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
<p class="bq">Wheeling to Pittsburg, via Washington, Pa., and with
numerous cross lines in Ohio.</p>

<p>The proprietors having been released on the 1st inst.
from burthen of carrying the great mail (which will
retard any line), are now enabled to run through in
a shorter time than any other line on the road. They
will use every exertion to accommodate the travelling
public. With stock infinitely superior to any on the
road, they flatter themselves they will be able to give
general satisfaction; and believe the public are aware,
from past experience, that a liberal patronage to the
above line will prevent impositions in high rates of
fare by any stage monopoly.</p>

<p>The proprietors of the Defiance Fast Line are making
the necessary arrangements to stock the Sandusky and
Cleveland Routes also from Springfield to Dayton&mdash;which
will be done during the month of July.</p>

<p>All baggage and parcels only received at the risk of

<p>The Cumberland Road became instantly a
great mail-route to Cincinnati and St. Louis;
from these points mails were forwarded by
packets to Louisville, Huntsville, Alabama,
Nashville, Tennessee, and all Mississippi points.

<p>The total of thirty-four appropriations
from March 29, 1806, to June 17, 1844, was
$6,824,919.33.</p>

<p>The old road was well built; nothing proves
this so well as the following advertisement for
bids for repairing it in Ohio in 1838:</p>

<p class="bq">"Sealed proposals will be received at Toll-gate No. 4,
until the 6th day of March next, for repairing that
part of the road lying between the beginning of the
23rd and end of the 42nd mile, and if suitable bids are
obtained, and not otherwise, contracts will be made at
Bradshaw's hotel in Fairview, on the 8th. Those who
desire contracts are expected to attend in person, in
order to sign their bonds.</p>

<p class="bq">"On this part of the Road three hundred rods or
upwards (82&frac12; cubic feet each) will be required on each
mile, of the best quality of limestone, broken evenly into
blocks not exceeding four ounces in weight each; and
specimens of the material proposed must be furnished,
in quantity not less than six cubic inches, broken and
neatly put up in a box, and accompanying each bid;
which will be returned and taken as the standard, both
as it regards the quality of the material and the preparation
of it at the time of measurement and inspection.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p class="bq">"The following conditions will be mutually understood
as entering into, and forming a part of the contract,
namely: The 23, 24, and 25 miles to be ready
for measurement and inspection on the 25th of July;
the 26, 27, and 28 miles on the 1st of August; the
29, 30, and 31 miles on the 15th of August; the 32,
33, and 34 miles on the 1st of September; the 35, 36,
37 miles on the 15th of September; the 38, 39, and
40 miles on the 1st of October; and the 41 and 42 miles,
if let, will be examined at the same time.</p>

<p class="bq">"Any failure to be ready for inspection at the time
above specified, will incur a penalty of five per cent for
every two days' delay, until the whole penalty shall
amount to 25 per cent on the contract paid. All the
piles must be neatly put up for measurement and no
pile will be measured on this part of the work containing
less than five rods. Whenever a pile is placed upon
deceptive ground, whether discovered at the time of
measurement or afterward, half its contents shall in
every case be forfeited for the use of the road.</p>

<p class="bq">"Proposals will also be received at the American
Hotel in Columbus, on the 15th of March, for hauling
broken materials from the penitentiary east of Columbus.
Bids are solicited on the 1, 2, and 3 miles counting
from a point near the Toll-gate towards the city. Bids
will also be received at the same time and place, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
collecting and breaking all the old stone that lies along
the roadside, between Columbus and Kirkersville, neatly
put in piles of not less than two rods, and placed on the
outside of the ditches."</p>

<p>The dawning of the era of slackwater navigation
and of the locomotive brought the public
to the realization, however, that a macadamized
road was not in 1838 all the wonder that it was
thought to be in 1806. But in its day the Cumberland
Road was a tremendous power in opening
a new country, in giving hope to a brave but
secluded people who had won and held the West
for the Union. This was why Henry Clay championed
the movement, and why he should be
remembered therefor. As a Kentuckian he knew
the Western problem, and with the swiftness of
genius he caught the true intent and deeper
meaning of a great national work such as the
building of such a material bond of union.
Nothing has done so much for civilization, after
the alphabet and the printing press, Macaulay
has said, as the inventions which have abridged
distance. In those years, quick with hopes and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
vast with possibility at the opening of the nineteenth
century, the Cumberland Road, stretching
its yellow coils out across the Alleghanies and
into the prairies, advanced civilization as no other
material object did or could have done. "If
there is any kind of advancement going on,"
wrote Bushnell, "if new ideas are abroad and new
hopes rising, then you will see it by the roads
that are building." This old road, worn out and
almost forgotten, its milestones tottering, its
thousand taverns silent where once all was life
and merriment, is a great monument of days
when advancement was a new word, when great
hopes were rising and great ideas were abroad.
As such it shall be remembered and honored as
one of the greatest and most timely acts of promotion
our young Government executed.</p>

we survey the
early period of
the nation's history,
there appear
a number
of famous conventions
of
notables which
will ever live
in the memory
of thoughtful
Americans.
There are, however,
a number of such gatherings that are not
familiar to many, and it is at one of these that
any story of the far-famed Erie Canal must
begin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>In the year 1777 General Schuyler's army was
at Fort Edward, New York, during its slow and
sullen retreat before Burgoyne's advancing redcoats.
Gouverneur Morris was sent to the army
at Fort Edward, and on a certain evening, amid
a company of army officers, that brilliant man
told a day-dream before the flickering camp-fire.
The dream concerned the future of America
when once the foreign yoke should be thrown off.
In language consonant with the fascinating
nature of his theme the speaker described in some
detail what would be the result on the minds and
hearts of men when liberty for all had been
secured, and the inspiring advance in arts and
letters, in agriculture and commerce, that would
come. He was a dreamer, but his dream became
a realization and the wonder of young America.
A comrade that night heard his words.</p>

<p>"He announced," wrote that person, Governor
Morgan Lewis, then Quartermaster-General, "in
language highly poetic, and to which I cannot
do justice, that at no very distant day the waters
of the great Western inland seas would, by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
aid of man, break through their barriers and
mingle with those of the Hudson. I recollect
asking him how they were to break through these
barriers. To which he replied, that numerous
streams passed them through natural channels,
and that artificial ones might be conducted by the
same routes."</p>

<p>A number of eminent authorities, such as
James Geddes, Simeon de Witt, and Elkanah
Watson, all leave evidence that the idea of a
canal from Lake Erie to the Hudson was first
brought to men's attention by the man who told
his vision to those sleepy Revolutionary officers
at Fort Edward.</p>

<p>In his diary of a journey in Scotland in 1795
Morris thus exclaims at the sight of the Caledonian
Canal, "When I see this, my mind opens
to a view of wealth for the interior of America,
which hitherto I had rather conjectured than
seen." Six years later he wrote to a friend, after
seeing ships on Lake Erie: "Hundreds of large
ships will, at no distant period, bound on the
billows of these inland seas.... Shall I lead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
your astonishment up to the verge of incredulity?
I will. Know then that one-tenth of the
expense borne by Great Britain in the last
campaign would enable ships to sail from London
through Hudson's River into Lake Erie."
Simeon de Witt said in 1822: "The merit of
first starting the idea of a direct communication
by water between Lake Erie and Hudson's River
unquestionably belongs to Mr. Gouverneur
Morris. The first suggestion I had of it was
from him. In 1803 I accidentally met with him
at Schenectady. We put up for the night at the
same inn and passed the evening together. He
then mentioned the project of 'tapping Lake
Erie,' as he expressed it himself, and leading its
water in an artificial river, directly across the
country to Hudson's River." James Geddes
first heard of the early canal idea from Mr.
Morris in 1804. "The idea," he said, "of saving
so much lockage by not descending to Lake
Ontario made a very lively impression on my
mind."</p>

<p>Looking back over the colonial history of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
America it is very interesting to note the part
that was played in our country's development by
inland navigation. Practically all the commerce
of the colonies was moved in canoes, sloops, and
schooners; the large number of Atlantic seaboard
rivers were the roads of the colonies, and
there were no other roads. In Pennsylvania and
Georgia a few highways were in existence; in
the province of New York there were only twelve
miles of land carriage. Villages, churches, and
courthouses in Maryland and Virginia were almost
always placed on the shore of the rivers,
for it was only by boat that the people could
easily go to meeting or to court. Indeed the
capital of the country, Washington, was located
upon the Potomac River, partly for the reason
that its founders believed that the Potomac was
to be the great commercial highway of the
eastern half of the continent.</p>

<p>As roads were the arteries of trade and travel
it was natural for our forefathers to hold the
opinion that to increase the commerce of the country
it was necessary only to increase the number
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
of navigable miles of the rivers. The story of
the struggle to improve the navigation of the
two rivers, Mohawk and Hudson, upon which
the attention of our earliest engineers centred,
occupies other pages of this volume; and
it is for us to note here the fact merely in
passing that, beginning with 1786, strenuous
efforts were made to render these waterways,
and a large number of less important rivers,
navigable. The efforts failed of success, the
reason being that engineering skill was not of
a grade high enough to master the problem.
And consequently, when the nineteenth century
dawned, we may say with fair regard to truth
that the campaigns that had been waging in a
number of the States for the betterment of
America's navigation by means of improved
rivers had failed and were discarded.</p>

<p>Then it was that public attention was turned
to the subject of making artificial water channels,
or canals. Generations before this, the great
Forth and Clyde Canal in Scotland had been
completed by Smeaton; the Royal Canal in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
Ireland was finished in 1792; the Schuylkill and
Susquehanna Canal in Pennsylvania had been
surveyed in 1762, and a few miles of it had been
dug in 1794; the Chesapeake and Delaware
Canal, though surveyed as early as 1764, was not
begun until 1804.</p>

<p>It was natural, therefore, that the idea of a
canal between the Hudson and Lake Erie should
have presented itself forcibly to New Yorkers
at this time, and all the latent possibilities were
aroused to activity in 1807 by the recommendation
made by President Jefferson in his message
to Congress in October, that the surplus money
in the Treasury of the United States be used
for undertaking a large number of internal
improvements. Whether or not Jefferson's
recommendation or some other preliminary proposal
of this kind may have inspired it, a New
Yorker named Jesse Hawley was now preparing
a series of articles advocating a canal
between the Hudson and the Lakes. Before
these articles, to which the name of "Hercules"
was signed, were ready to appear in print,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
Mr. Hawley changed his place of residence to
Pittsburg, and, oddly enough, it was in "The
Commonwealth," a Pittsburg paper, that the
first published broadside in behalf of an Erie
canal appeared; this was on the fourteenth day
of January, 1807. This series of articles, as a
whole, appeared in "The Genesee Messenger,"
of Canandaigua, weekly from October, 1807, to
March, 1808. The author had studied the problem
with great earnestness, though the Mohawk
River was to be used as a part of the system.
In February of the following year the idea
gained added impetus and circulation by a bill
offered in the New York Legislature; its author
was Joshua Forman, a member from Onondaga
County, and it read as follows:</p>

<p class="bq">"Whereas the President of the United States by his
message to Congress, delivered at their meeting in October
last, did recommend that the surplus money in the
treasury, over and above such sums as could be applied
to the extinguishment of the national debt, be appropriated
to the great national objects of opening canals
and making turnpike roads; And whereas the State
of New York, holding the first commercial rank in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
United States, possesses within herself the best route
of communication between the Atlantic and Western
waters, by means of a canal between the tide-waters of
the Hudson River and Lake Erie, through which the
wealth and trade of that large portion of the United
States bordering on the upper lakes would for ever
flow to our great commercial emporium; And whereas
the Legislatures of several of our sister States have
made great exertions to secure to their own States
the trade of that wide-extended country west of the
Alleghanies to those of this State; And whereas it
is highly important that these advantages should as
speedily as possible be improved, both to preserve and
increase the commerce and national importance of this
State: Resolved (if the honourable the Senate concur
herein), that a joint committee be appointed to take
into consideration the propriety of exploring, and
causing an accurate survey to be made of, the most
eligible and direct route for a canal to open a communication
between the tide-waters of the Hudson River and
Lake Erie; to the end that Congress may be enabled
to appropriate such sums as may be necessary to the
accomplishment of that great national object."</p>

<p>For a number of years the great project was
held in abeyance by a series of unforeseen events.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
First among these was the War of 1812, during
which the State of New York was the frontier
and saw a number of the most important campaigns.
Then, too, the inherent difficulties of the
project&mdash;the vast amount of ground necessarily
to be covered, the low plane of engineering
science at that day, the immeasurable difficulties
of gaining access to the interior of a heavily
wooded country, the low ebb of the financial condition
of the State&mdash;all combined to strengthen
the opposition to the canal. But its friends grew
in number and steadily grew in power. First
among them was Governor Clinton, who was so
closely allied with the great undertaking that its
enemies frequently called it "Clinton's Ditch";
Gouverneur Morris, Fulton, and Livingston
(who were just now succeeding in their steamboat
enterprise), Simeon de Witt, Thomas
Eddy, General Philip Schuyler, Chancellor Kent,
and Judges Yates and Platt are remembered as
the most influential promoters of America's first
great work of internal improvement.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, one of the most serious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
hindrances to the beginning of the work proved
in the end to be the great argument in its favor,
and that was the War of 1812. The act which
gave birth to the canal was passed by the New
York Legislature April 15, 1817, and then went
before the Council of Revision. "The ordeal
this bill met with in the Council of Revision,"
writes M. S. Hawley in his valuable pamphlet,
<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
"came near being fatal to it; it could not have
received a two-thirds vote after a veto. The
Council was composed of Lieutenant-Governor
John Taylor,&mdash;acting Governor, as President of
the Council,&mdash;Chief Justice Thompson, Chancellor
Kent, and Judges Yates and Platt. Acting
Governor Taylor was openly opposed to the
whole scheme. The Chief Justice was also opposed
to this bill. Chancellor Kent was in favor
of the canal, but feared it was too early for the
State to undertake this gigantic work. Judges
Yates and Platt were in favor of the bill; but
it was likely to be lost by the casting vote of
the acting Governor. Vice-President Tompkins
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
(recently the Governor) entered the room at
this stage of the proceedings, and, in an informal
way, joined in conversation upon the
subject before the Council, and in opposition to
this bill. He said: 'The late peace with Great
Britain was a mere truce, and we will undoubtedly
soon have a renewed war with that country;
and instead of wasting the credit and resources
of the State in this chimerical project, we ought
to employ all our revenue and credit in preparing
for war.'</p>

<p>"'Do you think so, sir?' said Chancellor Kent.</p>

<p>"'Yes, sir,' replied the Vice-President; 'England
will never forgive us for our victories, and,
my word for it, we shall have another war with
her within two years.'</p>

<p>"The Chancellor, then rising from his seat,
with great animation declared,</p>

<p>"'If we must have war ... I am in favor
of the canal, and I vote for the bill.'</p>

<p>"With that vote the bill became a law."</p>

<p>It is difficult for us to-day to realize what a
tremendous undertaking it was to try to throw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
this great "Ditch" of Clinton's across those
hundreds of miles of forest and swamp which,
for so many generations, had been known as the
"Long House of the Iroquois." As you fly
through that beautiful territory watered by the
Mohawk, Seneca, and Onondaga rivers to-day,
it is hardly possible to re-create, with any measure
of truth, the old-time appearance of the land.
It was well into the nineteenth century before
a good road was ever built in Central New York;
indeed, during the years while the Erie Canal
was being built, the necessary materials for the
building, and provisions for the builders, were
transported thither in the winter season because
at that time only was it accessible by any known
means of transportation. Think what it meant,
then, to dig a great trench through the heavily
wooded region where even the road-builders had
not had the temerity to go. It was the forest
growth that held back the road-maker; the
tangled forest, the heavily wooded overgrowth
that bound the heavy trees inextricably together.
The canal-builder had all that the road-maker
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
found to combat with above the ground,&mdash;the
tangled mesh of bush, vine, and tree,&mdash;but he
had also what was far more difficult to attack and
conquer, namely, the tremendous labyrinth of
roots that lay beneath the ground. Thus, his task
was double that of the road-maker; and look as
far as you will through our early history, you will
not find an enterprise launched on this continent
by any man or any set of men that will compare
in daring with the promotion of this great work
of interior improvement to which New York
now set herself.</p>

<p>For there was no hesitating. Within a very
few days of the passing of the act creating the
Erie Canal you could have seen surveyors and
chainmen pushing out into the shadowy forest-land,
driving five lines of stakes across New York
toward the setting sun. These men, like those
who sent them, were ridiculed everywhere they
went by some of the people; but still the ringing
blows grew fainter and fainter as those five lines
of stakes crept on up the Mohawk, along the
Seneca, through poisonous swamps, on the banks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
of running rivers, around the shores of the still-lying
lakes. Those who ridiculed prophesied
that next we would be building a bridge across
the Atlantic, and then a tunnel to China beneath
the Pacific; but the sneers and ridicule of that
portion of the people that will be fools all the
time could not stop those earnest stake-drivers
or the small army of men, mostly Americans,
who came in and worked with pick, shovel, and
wheelbarrow.</p>

<p>The two outer lines of stakes were sixty feet
apart; this indicated the space from which the
forest was to be cleared. Two lines of stakes
within these, measuring forty feet apart, represented
the exact width of the proposed canal;
and the remaining single line of stakes located
its mathematical centre. The whole distance of
the canal from Albany to Buffalo was divided
into three sections, and these sections were subdivided
into very small portions, which were let
to contractors. The first contract was signed
June 27, 1817, and work was begun at historic
Rome, New York, on the following Fourth of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
July, with appropriate ceremony. After a short
address by one of the commissioners, Samuel
Young, and amid a burst of artillery, Judge
Richardson, the first contractor, threw out the
first spadeful of earth.</p>

<p>To present-day readers acquainted with so
many wonderful feats of engineering of modern
days, the history of the building of this canal
must seem commonplace; the marvellous thing
about it, after all, was its conception and the
campaign of education which brought about its
realization. One of the romantic phases of the
story, that will forever be of interest to those
of us who can never know a primeval forest, was
the experience of the engineering corps crashing
their way through the New York forests, where
the surveyors' stakes could hardly be seen in the
dense gloom. Machinery unknown in America
at the time was called upon to perform this
arduous labor of grubbing and clearing this sixty-foot
aisle. One machine, working on the principle
of an endless screw connected with a cable,
a wheel, and a crank, enabled a single man to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
haul down a tree of the largest size without any
cutting. The machine being located at a distance
of one hundred feet from the foot of the tree,
the cable was attached to the trunk fifty or sixty
feet from the ground, a crank was turned, the
screw revolved, and the tree was soon prostrated,
as the force which could be exerted by this principle
was irresistible.</p>

<p>A machine for hauling out stumps was constructed
and operated as follows:</p>

<p class="bq">"Two strong wheels, sixteen feet in diameter, are
made and connected together by a round axle-tree,
twenty inches thick and thirty feet long; between these
wheels, and with its spokes inseparably framed into their
axle-tree, another wheel is placed, fourteen feet in diameter,
round the rim of which a rope is several times
passed, with one end fastened through the rim, and
with the other end loose, but in such a condition as to
produce a revolution of the wheel whenever it is pulled.
This apparatus is so moved as to have the stump, on
which it is intended to operate, midway between the
largest wheels, and nearly under the axle-tree; and these
wheels are so braced as to remain steady. A very strong
chain is hooked, one end to the body of the stump, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
its principal root, and the other to the axle-tree. The
power of horses or oxen is then applied to the loose
end of the rope above mentioned, and as they draw,
rotary motion is communicated, through the smallest
wheel, to the axle-tree, on which, as the chain hooked
to the stump winds up, the stump itself is gradually
disengaged from the earth in which it grew. After
this disengagement is complete, the braces are taken
from the large wheels, which then afford the means of
removing that stump out of the way, as well as of
transporting the apparatus where it may be made to
bear on another."</p>

<p>An implement devised for the underground
work demanded on the Erie Canal was a peculiar
plough having a very heavy blade by which the
roots of the trees were cut; two yoke of oxen
could draw this plough through any mesh of
roots none of which exceeded two inches in
diameter.</p>

<p>The middle section of the canal, from Rome
to Lockport, was completed in 1819, twenty-seven
miles being navigable in that year. By
1823 the canal was opened from Rochester to
Schenectady. Water was admitted into the canal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
between Schenectady and Albany in October of
that year; and by September, 1824, the line was
completed from Lockport to Black Rock Harbor
on Lake Erie.</p>

<p>In evidence of what the promoters of the Erie
Canal expected that highway would be to the
Central West we find this interesting fact:
Ohio, and even Kentucky, were called upon officially
to aid in raising the funds for its building.
Indeed, the commissioners in 1817 went so far
as to utter a threat against the States lying on
each side of New York in case they should not
be willing to contribute to the building of this
commercial route, which was to be for their common
benefit; this consisted in a threat to charge
high duties on articles transported to and from
those States and the Territories of the United
States. It would seem as though New York
never expected to be compelled to finance, unassisted,
the great work of improvement which
she began in 1817. Agents went canvassing for
her both in Vermont on the east and in Ohio on
the west for the purpose of raising contributions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
to the canal fund. Agents also were sent to
the national Government at Washington, and it
was believed that national aid could perhaps be
secured from the sale of the public lands in
Michigan, very much in the same way as the old
National Road was paid for in part by the sale
of lands in Ohio a decade before. Though assurances
of interest and sympathy were forthcoming
from the Government and from all the
interested States, there is no evidence at hand to
show that New York was aided to the extent of a
single penny from any extraneous source. To
this fact, we shall see in another chapter, may be
charged the opposition of New York delegates in
Congress to many government-aid propositions
that came up in the era of internal improvements.</p>

<p>As is usually the case, the expense of this
great work exceeded all the scheduled estimates;
but, as has seldom if ever been the case with
works of this character, the receipts from the
tolls on the Erie Canal also exceeded all estimates.
In only eight years following the completion
of the canal the receipts from it exceeded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
all estimates by nearly two and one-quarter millions
of dollars, whereas the total cost of the
canal, including the amount required for completion
and payment of all claims at the close
of the year 1824, was only $7,700,000. Indeed,
the success of the canal was so great that it was
hardly completed before plans for an enlargement
were necessary.</p>

<p>Yet on its completion a great celebration was
held, which probably was the most picturesque
pageant ever seen on this continent to that time.
For many days previous to the completion of
the work, committees in all the cities and villages
throughout the route of the canal were preparing
to do honor to Governor Clinton as he should
make a triumphal tour from end to end in the
first boat that made the journey. Looking back
through the years, the scene presented of the
Governor of that State sailing in a little flotilla
of canal boats from Buffalo to Albany, the
violent rejoicing of political friends along
the route, the demonstrations and orations by
the score, the transparencies, illuminations, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
jollifications, stand without a parallel in the
early history of our country. At the moment
when Clinton's boats weighed anchor at Buffalo,
a burst of artillery sent the message eastward;
cannon located along the route took up
the message, and in comparatively few moments
it was passed across the State to the metropolis.
When Clinton reached New York, the canal
boats having been towed down the Hudson, a
spectacular ceremony was performed off Sandy
Hook, where a keg of Lake Erie water was
poured into the sea in commemoration of the
wedding of the ocean and the lakes. The procession
in New York City was the greatest, it is
said, that had ever formed in America up to that
time. The illuminations were in harmony with
the whole scale of the celebration, as was true
of the grand ball in Lafayette Amphitheatre
in Laurens Street; here, in order to secure
necessary floor space, a circus building on one
side and a riding-school on the other were temporarily
united to make the largest ballroom in
America.</p>

<p>The Erie Canal was of tremendous national
importance in more ways than it is possible to
trace. The hopes and dreams of its promoters
were based on such sound principles, and the
work they planned was so well executed, that
the success of their adventure gave inspiration
to hundreds of other enterprises throughout
the length and breadth of the country. That
was the Erie Canal's great mission. It is hardly
necessary to say that the State of New York
reaped a great benefit from the successful prosecution
of the work. But it was not New York
alone that benefited; for the Erie Canal was
the one great early school of civil engineers in
the United States, and in all parts of the country,
from the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at Baltimore
to the Portland Canal at far-away Louisville,
Kentucky, the men who engineered New
York's great canal found valuable work to do.</p>

<p>It is most remarkable that now, at the beginning
of another century, the people of New
York should be planning a new Erie Canal;
and perhaps the most significant fact in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
connection with the one-thousand-ton barge canal
now projected is the fact that wherever rivers
are available, as for instance the Mohawk, these
are to be taken advantage of, showing that
modern engineering science approves the early
theory entertained by Washington and Morris
of the canalization of rivers. The old Erie
Canal cost upwards of eight millions, which was
deemed an immense sum at that day. It is
difficult always to measure by any monetary
standard the great changes that the passing
years have brought; but the new canal now to
be built is to cost one hundred and one millions,
which is in our time a comparatively moderate
sum. The influence of the building of the old
canal spread throughout the nation, and scores
of canals were projected in the different States;
it seems now that the influence of the promotion
of the new Erie Canal will likewise be felt
throughout the country. New York again leads
the way.</p>

the Cumberland
National Road
proved a tremendous
boon
to the young
West and meant
to the East
commercially all
that its promoters
hoped, other
means of transportation
were
being hailed loudly as the nineteenth century
dawned. Improved river-navigation was one of
these, and canals were another. When it was
fully realized how difficult was the transportation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
of freight across the Alleghanies on even the best
of roads, the cry was raised, "Cannot waterways
be improved or cut from Atlantic tide-water to
the Ohio River?"</p>

<p>In our story of Washington as promoter and
prophet it was seen that at the close of the Revolution
the late commander gave himself up at
once to the commercial problem of how the Potomac
River might be made to hold the Middle
West in fee. Passing westward in the Fall of
1784, he spent a month in the wilds of Northern
Virginia seeking for a pathway for canal or road
from the South Branch of the Potomac to the
Cheat River. The result of his explorations was
the classic letter to Harrison in 1784, calling
Virginia to her duty in the matter of binding the
East and West with those strongest of all bonds&mdash;commercial
routes bringing mutual benefit.</p>

<p>The immediate result was the formation of
the Potomac Company, which proposed to improve
the navigation of the Potomac from tide-water,
at Washington, D. C., to the highest
practicable point, to build a road from that point
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
to the nearest tributary of the Ohio River,
and, in turn, to improve the navigation of that
tributary.</p>

<p>One stands aghast at the amount of money
spent by our forefathers in the sorry attempt
to improve hundreds of unnavigable American
rivers. You can count numbers of them, even
between the Mohawk and Potomac, which were
probably the poorest investments made by early
promoters in the infant days of our Republic.
When, in the Middle Ages, river improvement
was common in Europe, it was proposed to
make an unnavigable Spanish river navigable.
The plan was stopped by a stately decree of
an august Spanish council on the following
grounds: "If it had pleased God that these
rivers should have been navigable, He would
not have wanted human assistance to have made
them such; but that, as He has not done it, it
is plain that He did not think it proper that it
should be done. To attempt it, therefore, would
be to violate the decree of His providence, and
to mend these imperfections which He designedly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
left in His works." It is certain that stockholders
in companies formed to improve the
Potomac, Mohawk, Lehigh, Susquehanna, and
scores of other American streams would have
heartily agreed that it was, in truth, a sacrilege
thus to violate the decrees of Providence.</p>

<p>With Washington as its president, however,
the Potomac Company set to work in 1785 to
build a canal around the Great Falls of the
Potomac, fifteen miles above Washington, D. C.,
and blast out a channel in the rocky rapids at
Seneca Falls and Shenandoah Falls. Even during
Washington's presidency, which lasted until
his election as President of the United States
in 1788, there was great difficulty in getting the
stockholders to remit their assessments. Other
troubles, such as imperfect surveys, mismanagement,
jealousy of managers, and floods, tended
to delay and discourage. The act of incorporation
demanded that the navigation from tide-water
to Cumberland, Maryland, be completed
in three years. Nearly a dozen times the Legislatures
of Maryland and Virginia, under whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
auspices the work was jointly done, postponed
the day of reckoning. By 1820 nearly a million
dollars had been emptied into the Potomac
River, and a commission then appointed to examine
the Company's affairs reported that the
capital stock and all tolls had been expended, a
large debt incurred, and that "the floods and
freshets nevertheless gave the only navigation
that was enjoyed."</p>

<p>By this time the Erie Canal had been partly
formed, and it was clear that it would prove a
tremendous success; its operation was no longer
a theory, and freight rates on merchandise across
New York had dropped from one hundred dollars
to ten dollars a ton. Of the many canals
(which were now proposed by the score) the
Potomac Canal, which should connect tide-water
with the Ohio River by way of Cumberland and
the Monongahela River, was considered of prime
importance. Virginia and Maryland (in other
words, Alexandria and Baltimore) had held, by
means of the roads they had built and promoted,
the trade of the West for half a century. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
Erie Canal seemed about to deprive them of it
all; the Potomac Canal must restore it! So the
Virginians believed, and on this belief they
quickly acted. The Potomac Canal Company&mdash;soon
re-named the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal
Company&mdash;was formed, and chartered by Virginia.
Maryland hesitated; could Baltimore be
connected by canal with the Potomac Valley?
Before this doubt was banished a national commission
had investigated the country through
which the proposed canal was to run, and reported
that its cost (the Company was capitalized at six
millions) would exceed twenty millions! The
seventy miles between the Potomac and the head
of the Youghiogheny alone would cost nearly
twice as much as the entire capital of the Company!
And soon it became clear that it was
impossible to build a connecting canal between
the Potomac and Baltimore.</p>

<p>The situation now became intensely exciting.
A resurvey of the canal route lowered the
previous high estimate, and the Virginians and
Marylanders (outside of Baltimore) believed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
fully that the Ohio and the Potomac could be
connected, and that the Erie Canal would not,
after all, monopolize the trade of the West.
Alexandria and Georgetown would then become
the great trade centres of the continental waterway
from tide-water to the Mississippi basin,&mdash;in
fact, secure the position Baltimore had held
for nearly a century. Baltimore had been a
famous market for Western produce during the
days of the turnpike and "freighter"; the rise
of the easy-gliding canal-boat, it seemed, was to
put an end to those prosperous days. Trade
already had become light; Philadelphia was
forging ahead, and even New York seemed
likely to become a rival of Baltimore's.</p>

<p>A Baltimore bank president&mdash;whose name
must be enrolled high among those of the great
promoters of early America&mdash;sat in his office
considering the gloomy situation. That he saw
it clearly there is no doubt; very likely his books
showed with irresistible logic that things were
not going well in the Maryland metropolis. This
man was Philip Evan Thomas, president of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
Mechanics' Bank. Before many days he conceived
the idea of building a railroad from Baltimore
to the West, which would bring back the
trade that had been slipping away since the turnpike
roads had been eclipsed by the canal. Baltimore's
position necessitated her relying on roads;
so far as the West was concerned there were no
waterways of which she could avail herself.
Railroads had been proving successful; one in
Massachusetts three miles long served the purposes
of a common road to a quarry advantageously.
At Mauch Chunk, Pennsylvania, a
railroad nine miles long connected a coal mine
and the Lehigh River. Heavy loads could be
deposited on the cars used on these roads, and
on a level or on an upgrade horses could draw
them with ease. If a short road was practicable,
why not a long one? A three-hundred-mile
railroad was as possible as a nine-mile
road. Mr. Thomas admitted to his counsels
Mr. George Brown; each had brothers in England
who forwarded much information concerning
the railway agitation abroad. On the night
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
of February 12, 1826, an invited company of
Baltimore merchants met at Mr. Thomas's home,
and the plan was outlined. A committee was
appointed to review the situation critically and
report in one week. On February 19 the report
was made, unanimously urging the formation
of a Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company.</p>

<p>The intense rivalry of the Chesapeake and
Ohio Canal Company and the Baltimore and
Ohio Railroad Company forms of itself a historical
novel. The name "Ohio" in their legal
titles signifies the root of jealousy. The trade of
the "Ohio country," which included all the trans-Alleghany
empire, was the prize both companies
would win. The story is the more interesting
because in the long, bitter struggle which to its
day was greater than any commercial warfare of
our time, the seemingly weaker company, handicapped
at every point by its stronger rival,
and also held back because of the slow advance
of the discoveries and improvements necessary
to its success, at last triumphed splendidly in the
face of every difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>The first act in the drama was to hold rival
inaugural celebrations. Accordingly, on July 4,
1828, two wonderful pageants were enacted, one
at Baltimore and the other at Washington. At
Baltimore the aged Charles Carroll of Carrollton,
the only surviving signer of the Declaration of
Independence, laid the "cornerstone" of the
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. At Washington,
President John Quincy Adams, amid the cheering
of thousands, lifted the first spadeful of
earth in the great work of digging a canal from
Washington to Cumberland. The fact that the
spade struck a root was in no wise considered
an ill omen. Redoubling his efforts, President
Adams again drove the implement into the
ground. The root held stoutly. Whereupon the
President threw off his coat, amid the wildest
cheering, and, with a powerful effort, sent the
spade full length downward and turned out its
hallowed contents upon the ground. Washington,
Georgetown, and Alexandria were represented
by dignified officials. Baltimore, so long
mistress of the commerce of the West, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
now to be distanced by the Potomac Valley
cities.</p>

<p>And it was soon seen that the Canal Company
did hold the key to the situation. Having inherited
the debts and assets of the old Potomac
Company, it also inherited something of more
value,&mdash;that priceless right of way up the
Potomac Valley, the only possible Western route
through Maryland for either a canal or a railroad.
The railroad struck straight from Baltimore
toward Harper's Ferry and the Point of
Rocks, on the Potomac; the Canal Company
immediately stopped its work by an injunction.
The only terms on which it agreed to permit its
rival to build to Harper's Ferry was that a
promise should be given that the Railroad Company
would not build any part of the road onward
to Cumberland, Maryland, until the canal should
have been completed to that point.</p>

<p>Could it have been realized at the time, this
blow was not wholly unfortunate. There were
problems before this first railroad company in
America more difficult than the gaining of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
right of way to Cumberland. Every feature
of its undertaking was in most primitive condition,&mdash;road-bed,
tracks, rails, sleepers, ties, cars,
all, were most simple. The road was an ordinary
macadamized pathway; the cars were common
stagecoaches, on smaller, heavier wheels. More
than all else, the motor force was an intrinsically
vital problem. Horses and mules were now being
used; a car with a sail was invented, but was, of
course, useless in calm weather, or when the wind
was not blowing in the right direction. In the
meantime the steam locomotive was being perfected,
and Peter Cooper's "Tom Thumb"
settled the question in 1830, on these tracks
of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. For a
number of years the ultimate practicability of
the machine was in question, but when the railroad
was in a position to expand westward, in
1836, the locomotive as a motor force was
acknowledged on every hand to be a success.
In all other departments, likewise, the railroad
had been improving. The six years had seen a
vast change.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>With the canal, on the other hand, these had
been discouraging years. Though master of
the legal situation, money came to it slowly,
labor became more costly, unexpected physical
difficulties were encountered, floods delayed
operations. Again and again aid from Maryland
had been invoked successfully; and now,
in 1836, it was reported that three millions more
was necessary to complete the canal to Cumberland.
Maryland now passed her famous "Eight-million-dollar
Bill," giving the railroad and canal
each three million dollars, with a condition imposed
on the Canal Company that the two companies
should have an equal right of way up the
Potomac to Cumberland. Though the directors
of the Canal Company objected bitterly at thus
being compelled to resign control of the situation,
the needs of the Company were such that
acquiescence was imperatively necessary. The
Chesapeake and Ohio Canal was completed to
Cumberland in 1851, at a cost of over eleven
million dollars, the root of Maryland's great
State debt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>The passage of this epoch-making law was
the turning-point in this long and fierce conflict.
It marked the day when the city of Baltimore
at last conquered the State of Maryland,&mdash;when
the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad mastered the
situation, of which in 1832 the canal was master.
The panic of 1837 delayed temporarily the sweep
of the railway up the Potomac to Cumberland,
but it reached that strategic point in 1842. Work
on the route across the mountains was begun at
various points, and the whole line was opened
almost simultaneously. The first division, from
Cumberland to Piedmont, was opened in June,
1851; by the next June the road was completed
to Fairmount on the Monongahela River; and
on the night of January 12, 1853, a banquet-board
was spread in the city of Wheeling to
celebrate the completion of the Baltimore and
Ohio Railroad to the Ohio River. Of the five
regular toasts of the evening none was so typical
or so welcome as that to the president under whose
auspices this first railway had been thrown across
the Alleghanies,&mdash;"Thomas Swann: standing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
upon the banks of the Ohio, and looking back
upon the mighty peaks of the Alleghanies, surmounted
by his efforts, he can proudly exclaim,
'Veni, vidi, vici.'"</p>

<p>The story of the building of the Pennsylvania
Canal, and later the Pennsylvania Railway, a
little to the north of the two Maryland works,
is not a story of bitter rivalry, but is remarkable
in point of enterprise and swift success; it also
shows another of the results of the successful
operation of the Erie Canal.</p>

<p>In 1824 the Pennsylvania Legislature authorized
the appointment of a commission to select
a route for a canal from Philadelphia to Pittsburg.
The success of New York's canal (now
practically completed) impressed the Pennsylvanians
as forcefully as it did Marylanders and
Virginians; Philadelphia desired to control the
trade of the West as much as New York or
Baltimore. The earnestness of the Pennsylvanians
could not be more clearly shown than
by the rapid building of their canal. The Chesapeake
and Ohio Canal up the Potomac Valley
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
was over twenty-five years in building; within
ten years of the time the above commission was
appointed, canal-boats could pass from Philadelphia
to Pittsburg. The route, at first, was
by the Schuylkill to the Union Canal, which
entered the Susquehanna at Middletown; this
was nominally the eastern division of the Pennsylvania
Canal, it having been completed in 1827.
The central division extended from Middletown
(later from Columbia) up the Susquehanna and
Juniata rivers to Hollidaysburg. This division
was completed in 1834, at a cost of nearly five
and one-half millions. The western division ran
from Johnstown down the Conemaugh, Kiskiminetas,
and Alleghany valleys; it was completed
to Pittsburg in 1830, at a cost of a little over
three millions.</p>

<p>As stated, canal-boats could traverse this course
as early as 1834, and the uninformed must wonder
how a canal-boat could vault the towering crest
lying between Hollidaysburg and Johnstown,
which the Pennsylvania Railway crosses with
difficulty at Gallitzin, more than two thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
feet above sea-level. The answer to this introduces
us to the Alleghany Portage Railway, a
splendid piece of early engineering, which deserves
mention in any sketch of early deeds of
expansion and promotion in America.</p>

<p>The feat was accomplished by means of inclined
planes; the idea was not at all new, but,
under the circumstances, it was wholly an experiment.
The plan was to build a railway which
could contain eleven sections with heavy grades,
and between them ten inclined planes. A canal-boat
having been run into a submerged car in
the basin on either side of the mountain, it could
be drawn over the level by horses or locomotives,
and sent over the summit, 1,441 feet above Hollidaysburg,
on the inclines by means of stationary
engines. The scheme was first advanced early
in the history of the canal, but it was not finally
adopted until 1831, and in three years the portage
railway was opened for traffic. The ten planes
averaged about 2,000 feet in length and about
200 feet in elevation. They were numbered from
west to east. Certain of the levels were quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
long, that between Planes No. 1 and No. 2 being
thirteen miles in length; the total length of the
road was thirty-six miles. It was built through
the primeval forests, and an aisle of one hundred
and twenty feet in width (twice as wide as that
made for the Erie Canal) was cleared, so that the
structure would not be in danger of the falling
trees which were continually blocking early highways
and demolishing pioneer bridges. Two
names should be remembered in connection with
this momentous work,&mdash;Sylvester Welch and
Moncure Robinson, the chief and the consulting
engineer who erected it.</p>

<p>It was in October, 1834, that the first boat, the
"Hit or Miss" from the Lackawanna, was sent
over the Alleghany Portage Railway intact.
According to a local newspaper, it "rested at
night on the top of the mountain [Blair's Gap],
like Noah's Ark on Ararat, and descended the
next morning into the valley of the Mississippi
and sailed for St. Louis." Fifty years before,
to the month, the pioneer expansionist, Washington,
was floundering along in Dunkard Bottom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
seeking a way for a boat to do what the "Hit
or Miss" did in those October days of 1834. It
is a far cry, measured by hopes and dreams, back
to Washington, but one feature of the picture
is of great interest: in Washington's famous
appeal to Governor Harrison in 1784 he said
of the young West: "The Western inhabitants
would do their part [in forming a route of communication].... Weak
as they are, they would
meet us halfway." What a splendid comment
on Washington's wisdom and foresight it is to
record that the ten stationary engines on the
Alleghany Portage Railway, which hauled the
first load of freight that ever crossed the crest
of the Alleghanies by artificial means, were made
in the young West, in Pittsburg! The West
was certainly ready to meet the East halfway
when their union was to be perfected.</p>

<p>But no sooner was the Pennsylvania Canal in
working order than the success of railways was
conceded on every hand. At first the eastern
section of the canal was superseded by the
Philadelphia and Columbia Railway, a portage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
railway from the Schuylkill to the Susquehanna.
Then, in 1846 the Pennsylvania Railroad Company
was organized. The old route was found
to be the best. The advance was rapid. In two
years the road was open to Lewisburg in the
Juniata Valley; the western division from Pittsburg
to Johnstown was also built rapidly, and
in 1852 communication was possible between
Pittsburg and Philadelphia, the Alleghany
Portage Railway still serving to connect Hollidaysburg
and Johnstown. In 1854 this cumbersome
method was superseded by the railway over
the mountain by way of Gallitzin.</p>

<p>The Pennsylvania Canal, instead of delaying
the Pennsylvania Road, assisted it, for the latter
was encouraged by the State, and the State
owned the canal. In 1857 the railway bought
both the canal and its portage railway. The
latter was closed almost immediately; the canal
has been operated by a separate company under
the direction of the Pennsylvania Railroad. But
the whole western division from Pittsburg to
Johnstown was closed in 1864, and the portion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
in the Juniata Valley was abandoned in 1899,
and that in the Susquehanna Valley in 1900.</p>

<p>Two magnificent railways, standing prominent
among the great railways of the world, have
succeeded the old canals and that old-time Alleghany
Portage Railway. But these great successes
are not their richest possessions; they
still own, we may well believe, that spirit which
wrought success out of difficulty,&mdash;the persistent,
irresistible ambition to better present conditions
and overcome present difficulties, which
is the very essence of American genius and the
great secret of America's progress. If you
wish a painting that will portray the secret of
America's marvellous growth, ask that the artist's
brush draw Philip Evan Thomas in his bank
office at Baltimore, struggling with the problem
how his city could retain the trade of the West;
or draw Sylvester Welch struggling with his
plans for the inclined planes of the Alleghany
Portage Railway. There, in those eager, unsatisfied,
and hopeful men, you will find the
typical American.</p>

the vast
region known as
Louisiana was
purchased by
President Jefferson,
a century
ago, the
American people
knew as
little about it as
the American
colonies knew
about the great
territory called New France which came under
English sovereignty at the end of the French
War, fifty years earlier. But however great
Louisiana was, and whatever its splendid stretch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
of gleaming waterway or rugged mountain
range, it was sure that the race which now became
its master would not shirk from solving the tremendous
problems of its destiny. In 1763 the
same race had taken quiet possession of New
France, including the whole empire of the Great
Lakes and all the eastern tributaries of the Mississippi
River; in the half-century since that
day this race had proved its vital powers of successful
exploitation of new countries. In those
fifty years a Tennessee, a Kentucky, an Ohio,
and an Indiana and Illinois had sprung up out
of an unknown wilderness as if a magician's
wand had touched, one by one, the falling petals
of its buckeye blossoms. Thus, New France had
been acquired by a great kingdom, but the power
of assimilation lay in the genius of the common
people of England's seaboard colonies for home-building
and land-clearing. Soon the era of
brutal individualism passed from the Middle
West and the old Northwest; weak as it was,
the young American Republic, in the person of
such men as Richard Henderson and Rufus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
Putnam, threw an arm about the wilderness,
while George Rogers Clark, "Mad Anthony"
Wayne, and William Henry Harrison settled
the question of sovereignty with the red-skinned
inhabitants of the land.</p>

<p>Civilization often marched rough-shod into
the American Middle West, bringing, however,
better days and ideals than those which it
harshly crushed. After Anthony Wayne's conquest
of Northwestern Indiana at Fallen Timber
(near Toledo, Ohio) in 1794 the burst of population
westward from Pittsburg and Kentucky
to the valley of the Mississippi was marvellous;
by the time of the purchase of Louisiana in
1803 the rough vanguard of the race which had
so swiftly opened Kentucky and Ohio and Tennessee
to the world was crowding the banks of
the Mississippi, ready to leap forward to even
greater conquests. What these irrepressible
pioneers had done they could do again. Those
who affirmed that the purchase of Louisiana
must prove a failure had counted without their
host.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing is of more interest in the great Government
expedition of exploration which President
Jefferson now sent into the unknown
territory beyond the Mississippi than this very
fact of vital connection between the leaders of
the former movement into the eastern half of the
Mississippi Basin and this present movement
into its tremendous western half. In a previous
story we have shown that the founders of the
old Northwest were largely heroes of the French
and Indian and the Revolutionary wars; it is
now interesting indeed to note that these leaders
in Far Western exploration&mdash;Meriwether Lewis
and William Clark&mdash;were in turn heroes of
the British and Indian wars, both of them survivors
of bloody Fallen Timber, where, on the
cyclone's path, Anthony Wayne's hard-trained
soldiers made sure that Indian hostility was
never again to be a national menace on the
American continent.</p>

  <i>Of the Lewis and Clark Expedition</i></div>
</div>

<p>The proposed exploration of Louisiana by
Lewis and Clark is interesting also as the
first scientific expedition ever promoted by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
American Government. For it was a tour of
exploration only; the party did not carry leaden
plates such as CÃ©loron de Bienville brought fifty
years back in those days of gold interwoven with
purple, to bury along the tributaries of the Ohio
as a claim to land for his royal master and the
mistresses of France. There was here no question
of possession; Lewis and Clark were, on the
contrary, to report on the geography, physiography,
and zoÃ¶logy of the land, designate proper
sites for trading stations, and give an account
of the Indian nations. It is remarkable that
little was known of Louisiana on these heads.
Of course the continent had been crossed,
though not by way of the Missouri River route,
which had become the great highway for the
fur trade. Mackenzie had crossed the continent
in the Far North, and Hearne had passed over
the Barren Grounds just under the Arctic Circle.
To the southward from the Missouri the Spaniards
had run to and from the Pacific for two
centuries. The commanding position of St.
Louis showed that the Missouri route was of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
utmost importance; the portage to the half-known
Columbia was of strategic value, and a
knowledge of that river indispensable to sane
plans, commercial and political, in the future.</p>

<p>In May, 1804, the explorers were ready to
start from St. Louis. They numbered twenty-seven
men and the two leading spirits, Lewis and
Clark; fourteen of the number were regular
soldiers from the United States army; there
were nine adventurous volunteers from Kentucky;
a half-breed interpreter; two French
voyageurs and Clark's negro servant completed
the roster. The party was increased by the
addition of sixteen men, soldiers and traders,
whose destination was the Mandan villages on
the Missouri, where the explorers proposed to
spend the first Winter.</p>

<p>There is something of the simplicity of real
grandeur in the commonplace records of the
leaders of this expedition. "They were men
with no pretensions to scientific learning," writes
Roosevelt, "but they were singularly close and
accurate observers and truthful narrators. Very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
rarely have any similar explorers described so
faithfully not only the physical features, but the
animals and plants of a newly discovered land.
... Few explorers who did and saw so much
that was absolutely new have written of their
deeds with such quiet absence of boastfulness,
and have drawn their descriptions with such
complete freedom from exaggeration."</p>

<p>The very absence of incident in the story is
significant to one who remembers the countless
dangers that beset Lewis and Clark as they
fared slowly on up the long, tiresome stretches
of the Missouri; surprises, accidents, misunderstandings,
miscalculations, and mutinies might
have been the order of the day; a dozen instances
could be cited of parties making journeys
far less in extent than that now under
consideration where the infelicities of a single
week surpassed those known throughout those
three years. These splendid qualities, which can
hardly be emphasized save in a negative way,
make this expedition as singular as it was auspicious
in our national annals. Good discipline
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
was kept without engendering hatred; the leaders
worked faithfully with their men at the hardest
and most menial tasks; in suffering, risking,
laboring, they set examples to all of their party.
In dealing with the Indians good judgment was
used; even in the land of the fierce Dakotas
they escaped harm because of great diplomacy,
presenting a more bold and haughty front than
could perhaps have been maintained if once it
had been challenged. With all Indian nations
conferences were held, at which the purchase of
Louisiana from France was officially announced,
and proper presents were distributed in sign of
the friendship of the United States.</p>

<p>The Winter of 1804-1805 was spent at Fort
Mandan, on the Missouri River, sixteen hundred
miles from its junction with the Mississippi. In
the Spring the party, now thirty-two strong,
pressed on up the Missouri, which now turned in a
decidedly westward direction. Between the Little
Missouri and the upper waters of the Missouri
proper, game was found in very great quantities,
this region having been famous in that respect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
until the present generation. One game animal
with which white men had not been acquainted
was now encountered,&mdash;the grizzly bear. Bears
in the Middle West were, under ordinary circumstances,
of no danger; these grizzlies of the
upper Missouri were very bold and dangerous.
Few Indians were encountered on the upper
Missouri. Fall had come ere the party had
reached the difficult portage from the Missouri
to the Columbia; the distance from the Mississippi
to the Falls of the Missouri, at the mouth
of the Portage River, the point near which the
land journey began, was 2,575 miles. The Portage
to the Columbia was 340 miles in length.
Having obtained horses from the Shoshones, the
Indians on the portage, the explorers accomplished
the hard journey through the Bitter Root
Mountains.</p>

<p>The strange white men were received not
unkindly by the not less strange Indians of the
great Columbia Valley, though it needed a bold
demeanor, in some instances, to maintain the
ground gained. Yet on the men went down the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
river and encamped for the Winter on the coast
near Point Adams,&mdash;the end of a journey of
over four thousand miles. Here the brave Captain
Gray of Boston, thirteen years before, had
discovered the mouth of the Columbia and given
the river the name of his good ship. The Winter
was spent hereabouts, the explorers suffering
somewhat for lack of food until they learned to
relish dog-flesh, the taste for which had to be
acquired. By March, 1806, they were ready to
pull up stakes and begin the long homeward
journey.</p>

<p>This was almost as barren of adventure as the
outward passage, though a savage attack by a
handful of Blackfeet,&mdash;henceforward to be the
bitter foes of Rocky Mountain traders and pioneers,&mdash;and
the accidental wounding of Lewis
by one of his party, were unpleasant interruptions
in the monotony of the steady marching,
paddling, and hunting. It is remarkable that,
throughout the western expansion of the United
States after the Revolution, our northern pioneers
from Pennsylvania to Oregon should have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
felt&mdash;in many cases bitterly&mdash;the tricky, insulting
hatred of British traders and their Indian
allies. As Washington in 1790 laid at the door
of British instigators the cause of the long war
ended by Wayne at Fallen Timber, so, all the
way across the continent our pioneers had to
contend with the same despicable influence, and
were driven by it to deeds which made them, in
turn, equally despised by their northern rivals.
"I was in hopes," wrote an early pioneer, "that
the British Indian traders had some bounds to
their rapacity ... that they were completely
saturated with our blood. But it appears not to
have been the case. Like a greedy wolf, not
satisfied with the flesh, they quarrelled over the
bones.... Alarmed at the individual enterprise
of our people ... they furnished [the Indians]
with ... the instruments of death and a passport
[horses] to our bosom." Even at the very
beginning these first Americans on the Columbia
and the Bitter Root range had a taste of Indian
hatred from both the Blackfeet and the Crows.</p>

<p>On the way back to the Mandan villages the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
explorers had an experience which was by no
means insignificant. As they were dropping
down the upper Missouri, one day two men came
into view; they proved to be American hunters,
Dickson and Hancock by name, from Illinois.
They had been plundered by the fierce Sioux,
and one of them had been wounded; it can be
imagined how glad they were to fall in with
a party large enough to ward off the insults
of the Sioux. The hunters did remain with
Lewis and Clark until the Mandan villages were
reached, but no longer. Obtaining a fresh start,
the two turned back toward the Rockies, and
one of Lewis and Clark's own soldiers, Colter
(later the Yellowstone pioneer), went back with
them. These three led the van of all the pioneer
host under whose feet the western half of the
continent was soon to tremble.</p>

<p>Holding the Sioux safely at bay during the
passage down the Missouri, Lewis and Clark in
September were once again on the straggling
streets of the little village of St. Louis, then
numbering perhaps a thousand inhabitants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>From any standpoint this expedition must rank
high among the tours of the world's greatest
explorers; a way to the Pacific through Louisiana,
which had just been purchased, was now
assured. Knowing as we do so well to-day of
Russia's determined effort to secure an outlet
for her Asiatic pioneers and commerce on the
Pacific Ocean, we can realize better the national
import of Lewis's message to President Jefferson
giving assurance that there was a practicable
route from the Mississippi Basin to the Pacific by
way of the tumbling Columbia. Without guides,
save what could be picked up on the way, these
men had crossed the continent; and as the story
told by returning Kentucky hunters to wondering
pioneers in their Alleghany cabins set on foot the
first great burst of immigration across the Alleghanies
into the Ohio Basin, so in turn the story
of Lewis and Clark and Gass and the others set
on foot the movement which resulted in the entire
conquest of the Rockies and the Great West.</p>

<p>But as the stories of others besides Kentuckians
played a part in the vaulting of the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
great America "divide," so, too, others besides
Lewis and Clark influenced the early movement
into the Farthest West. One of these, who
stands closest to the heroes of the Missouri and
Columbia, was Zebulon M. Pike, a son of a
Revolutionary officer from New Jersey, the
State from which the pioneers of Cincinnati and
southwestern Ohio had come. During Lewis
and Clark's adventure this hardy explorer ascended
the Mississippi, August, 1805, in a keel-boat,
with twenty regular soldiers. The Indians
of the Minnesota country were not openly hostile,
but their conduct was anything but friendly.
The Winter was spent at the beautiful Falls of
St. Anthony, at Minneapolis. Pike explored the
Leech Lake region but did not reach Lake
Itasca. He found the British flag floating
over certain small forts built by British traders,
which he in every case ordered down. An
American flag was raised in each instance, and
the news of the Louisiana purchase was noised
abroad. The British traders treated Pike's band
with all the kindness and respect that their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
well-armed condition demanded. The expedition
came down the Mississippi in April, 1806,
to St. Louis.</p>

<p>There were other regions, however, in Louisiana
where the United States flag ought to go
now, and General Wilkinson, who had sent Pike
to the North, now ordered him into the Far
West. Pike's route was up the Osage and overland
to the Pawnee Republic on Republican
River. His party numbered twenty-three, and
with him went fifty Osages, mostly women and
children, who had been captured in savage war
by the Pottawattomies. The diplomatic return
of these forlorn captives of course determined
the attitude of the Osage nation toward Pike's
company and his claims of American sovereignty
over the land. And it was time for
America to extend her claim and make it good.
Already a Spanish expedition had passed along
the frontier distributing bright Spanish flags
and warning the Indians that the Spanish boast
of possession was still good and would be made
better. Pike travelled in the wake of this band
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
of interlopers, neutralizing the effect of its influence
and raising the American flag everywhere
in place of the Spanish.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">William Clark</span><br />
  <i>Of the Lewis and Clark Expedition</i></div>
</div>

<p>Reaching the Arkansas, Pike ascended that
river late in the Fall, and when Winter set in the
brave band was half lost in the mountains near
the towering peak which was forever to stand a
dazzling monument to the hardihood and resolution
of its leader. At the opening of the new
year, near Canyon City, where deer were found
wintering, a log fort was built in which a portion
of the party remained with the pack animals,
while Pike with twelve soldiers essayed the desperate
journey to the Rio Grande.</p>

<p class="bq">"Their sufferings were terrible. They were almost
starved, and so cold was the weather that at one time
no less than nine of the men froze their feet.... In
the Wet Mountain Valley, which they reached in mid-January, ...
starvation stared them in the face.
There had been a heavy snow-storm; no game was to
be seen; and they had been two days without food.
The men with frozen feet, exhausted by hunger, could
no longer travel. Two of the soldiers went out to hunt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
but got nothing. At the same time Pike [and a comrade]
... started, determined not to return at all
unless they could bring back meat. Pike wrote that
they had resolved to stay out and die by themselves,
rather than to go back to camp 'and behold the misery
of our poor lads.' All day they tramped wearily
through the heavy snow. Towards evening they came
on a buffalo, and wounded it; but faint and weak from
hunger, they shot badly, and the buffalo escaped; a
disappointment literally as bitter as death. That night
they sat up among some rocks, all night long, unable
to sleep because of the intense cold, shivering in their
thin rags; they had not eaten for three days. But
... they at last succeeded, after another heartbreaking
failure, in killing a buffalo. At midnight
they staggered into camp with the meat, and all the
party broke their four days' fast."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Pike at length succeeded in his design of
reaching the Rio Grande, and here he built a
fort and threw out to the breeze an American
flag, though knowing well that he was on Spanish
territory now. The Louisiana boundary was
ill defined, but in a general way it ran up the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
Red River, passed a hundred miles northeast of
Santa FÃ© and just north of Salt Lake, thence
it struck straight west to the Pacific. By any
interpretation the Rio Grande was south of the
line. The Spaniards, who came suddenly upon
the scene, diplomatically assumed that the daring
explorer had lost his way; he suffered nothing
from their hands, and was sent home through
Chihuahua and Texas.</p>

<p>All the hopes of the purchasers of Old Louisiana
and of its flag-planters have come true, and,
with them, dreams the most feverish brain of
that day could not fashion. History has repeated
itself significantly as our standard-bearers have
gone westward. When the old Northwest was
carved out of a wilderness, there was no fear in
the hearts of our forefathers that was not felt
when Louisiana was purchased. The great fear
in each case was the same&mdash;the British at the
north and the Spaniard at the south. And in
each case the leaven of the East was potent to
leaven the whole lump. Great responsibilities
steady nations as well as men; the very fact of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
a spreading frontier and a widening sphere of
influence&mdash;bringing alarm to some and fear to
many&mdash;was of appealing force throughout a
century to the conscience and honor of American
statesmen. As, in the dark days of the Revolution,
the wary Washington determined, in case
of defeat, to lead the fragment of his armies
across the Alleghanies and fight the battles over
again in the Ohio Basin, where he knew the pioneers
would forever keep pure the spirit of independence,
so men in later years have looked
confidently to the Greater West, to the Mississippi
Basin and old Louisiana, for as pure a
patriotism (though it might appear at times in
a rough guise) as ever was breathed at Plymouth
Rock.</p>

brave explorations
of
Lewis and
Clark and Pike
opened up the
vast Territory
of Louisiana
for occupation
and commerce.
The one great
business in the
Northwest had
been the fur
trade, and for a long period it was yet to be the
absorbing theme of promoters and capitalists,
the source of great rivalries, great disappointments,
and great fortunes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>No story of American promotion is more
unique than that of the rise of the Astor family
from obscurity to a position of power and usefulness,
and this story has its early setting in
the fur-trading camps of the Far Northwest,
where Astoria arose beside the Pacific Sea. The
tale is most typically American: Its hero, John
Jacob Astor, was of foreign parentage; he came
to America poor; he seized upon an opening
which others had passed over; he had the support
of a self-confidence that was not blind; he
fought undauntedly all obstacles and scorned all
rivalry; and at last he secured America's first
princely fortune.</p>

<p>Until the beginning of the nineteenth century
the fur trade of the Northwest was in the hands
of the powerful Northwest Company of Montreal,
a race of merchant princes about whose
exploits such a true and brilliant sheen of romance
has been thrown. But the United States
Government was not content that Canadian
princes alone should get possession of the wealth
of the Northern forests, and as early as 1796 it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
sent agents westward to meet the Indians and
to erect trading-houses. The plan was a failure,
as any plan must have been "where the dull
patronage of Government is counted upon to
outvie the keen activity of private enterprise."
In almost every one of our preceding stories of
America's captains of expansion, save that of
the Lewis and Clark expedition only, a private
enterprise has been our study, and each story has
been woven around a personality. Even in the
case of the exception noted, it was the personal
interest and daring of Lewis and Clark that
made their splendid tour a success, though it was
promoted by the Government.</p>

<p>The quiet little village of Waldorf near Heidelberg,
Germany, was the birthplace of John
Jacob Astor, and the name is preserved to-day
in the princely splendor of the Waldorf-Astoria
Hotel. The young man, who never believed
that he would become a merchant prince, spent
his first years in the most rural simplicity. It
is marvellous how America has imperiously called
upon so many distant heaths for men with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
genius for hard work and for daring dreams;
it called St. Clair from Scotland, Zeisberger
from Moravia, and Gallatin and Bouquet from
Switzerland; and now a German peasant boy,
inheriting blood and fibre, felt early in his veins
this same mystic call, and saw visions of a future
possible only in a great and free land. At an
early age he went to London, where he remained
in an elder brother's employ until the close of
the Revolutionary War; now, in 1783, at twenty
years of age, he left London for America with
a small stock of musical instruments with which
his brother had supplied him. At this time one
of those strange providential miracles in human
lives occurred in the life of this lad, who himself
had had a large faith since childhood days; by
mere chance, on the ocean voyage, or in the ice-jam
at Hampton Roads, his mind was directed
to the great West and its fur trade. From just
what point the leading came strongest is not of
great importance, but the fact remains that upon
his arrival at New York young Astor disposed of
his musical instruments and hastened back to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
London with a consignment of furs. The transaction
proved profitable, and the youth turned
all his energies to the problem of the fur trade.
He studied the British market, and went to the
continent of Europe and surveyed conditions
there. He returned to New York and began in
the humblest way to found his great house. All
imaginable difficulties were encountered; the fur
trade had been confined almost wholly to the
Canadian companies, who brooked no competition;
in the Atlantic States it had been comparatively
unimportant and insignificant. At the
close of the war of separation England had refused
to give up many of her important posts on
the American side of the Great Lakes,&mdash;a galling
hindrance to all who sought to interest themselves
in the fur trade. Again, the importation
of furs from Canada to the United States was
prohibited. The young merchant soon began
making trips to Montreal, at which point he purchased
furs and shipped them direct to London.</p>

<p>In this fight for position and power young
Astor showed plainly the great characteristics
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
of the successful merchant,&mdash;earnestness and
faith. He showed, too, some of the rashness of
genius, which at times is called insanity; but
search in the biographies of our great Americans,
and how many will you find who did not early
in their careers have some inkling of their great
successes,&mdash;some whisper of fortune which rang
in the young heart? The successes of John Jacob
Astor were not greater than some of his day-dreams.
"I'll build one day or other," he once
said to himself on Broadway, "a greater house
than any of these, in this very street." Irving
writes of Astor:</p>

<p class="bq">"He began his career, of course, on the narrowest
scale; but he brought to the task a persevering industry,
rigid economy, and strict integrity. To these
were added an inspiring spirit that always looked upward;
a genius, bold, fertile, and expansive; a sagacity
quick to grasp and convert every circumstance to its advantage;
and a singular and never-wavering confidence
of signal success."</p>

<p>It was the reports of Lewis and Clark that
inspired Astor in his daring dream of securing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
a commercial control of the great Northwest
which, by the help and protection of the American
Government, would give impetus to the expansion
of the American people into a great empire. The
key to Astor's plan was to open an avenue of
intercourse between the Atlantic and Pacific
oceans and form regular establishments or settlements
across the continent from one headquarters
on the Atlantic to another on the Pacific. Sir
Alexander Mackenzie had conceived this idea in
1793, but it involved such herculean labors that
it was not attempted; the business sinews of the
Hudson Bay Company and the Northwest Company
were so strong, and their long-cherished
jealousies were so deep-rooted, that Mackenzie's
plan of coalescence was impossible. In the meantime
Lewis and Clark had found a route through
Louisiana to the Pacific, and Captain Gray of
Boston had anchored in the mouth of the Columbia.
By land and water the objective point had
been reached, and Astor entered upon the great
task of his life with ardor and enthusiasm. The
very obstacles in his way seemed to augment his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
courage, and every repulse fired him to increased
exertion.</p>

      alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">John Jacob Astor</span><br />
  <i>Founder of Astoria</i></div>
</div>

<p>It is a remarkable fact that at this time the
principal market for American furs was in
China. The British Government had awarded
the monopoly of the China trade to the powerful
East India Company, and neither the Hudson
Bay Company nor the Northwest Company was
allowed to ship furs westward across the Pacific
to China. Astor planned to take full advantage
of this ridiculous handicap under which the Canadian
fur companies labored. He planned to erect
a line of trading posts up the Missouri and down
the Columbia, at whose mouth a great emporium
was to be established; and to this the lesser posts
which were to be located in the interior would all
be tributary. A coastwise trade would be established,
with the Columbia post as headquarters.
Each year a ship was to be sent from New York
to the Columbia, loaded with reÃ«nforcements and
supplies. Upon unloading, this ship was to take
the year's receipt of furs and sail to Canton, trading
off its rich cargo there for merchandise; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
voyage was to be continued to New York, where
the Chinese cargo was to be turned into money.</p>

<p>It is not because of the success of this intrepid
promoter that the founding of Astoria occupies
such a unique position among the great exploits
in the history of American expansion. His attempt
to secure the fur trade was not a success;
but, considering the day in which it was conceived,
the tremendous difficulties to be overcome, the
rivalry of British and Russian promoters in the
North and Northwest, and the inability of others
to achieve it, the founding of Astoria on the
Columbia must be considered typically American
in the optimism of its conception and the daring
of its accomplishment. If there is a good sense
in which the words can be used, America has been
made by a race of gamblers the like of which the
world has never seen before. We have risked
our money as no race risked money before
our day. Astor was perhaps the first great
"plunger" of America; his enthusiasm carried
everything before it and influenced the spread
of American rights and interests. The failure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
of the Astoria scheme did not check certain more
fundamental movements toward the Pacific; the
questions of boundaries and territorial and international
rights were brought to the fore because
of Astor's attempt. This promoter's lifelong
enterprise was a highly important step, after the
Lewis and Clark expedition, toward the Americanization
of the newly purchased Louisiana; it
hastened the settlement of questions which had
to be faced and solved before Louisiana was ours
in fact as well as on paper. Lewis and Clark
found a way thither and announced to the Indian
nations American possession; Astor, by means
of a private enterprise, precipitated the questions
of boundaries and rights which America and
England must have settled sooner or later.</p>

<p>One of the first interesting developments of
an international nature followed close upon a
diplomatic man&oelig;uvre by which Astor attempted
to thwart rivalry by seeking to have the Northwest
Company become interested to the extent
of a one-third share in his American company.
The wily Canadians delayed their decision, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
at last answered by attempting to secure the
mouth of the Columbia before Astor's party
could reach the spot. Astor pushed straight
ahead, however, and on June 23, 1810, the Pacific
Fur Company was organized, with Mr. Astor,
Duncan McDougal, Donald McKenzie, and
Wilson Price Hunt as chief operators.</p>

<p>The stock in this newly formed company was
to be divided into one hundred equal shares, fifty
of which were to be at the disposal of Mr. Astor,
the remaining fifty to be divided among the partners
and associates. Mr. Astor was immediately
placed at the head of the Company, to manage
its business in New York. He was to furnish all
vessels, provisions, ammunition, goods, arms, and
all requisites for the enterprise, provided they did
not involve a greater advance than four hundred
thousand dollars. To Mr. Astor was given the
privilege of introducing other persons into the
Company as partners. None of them should be
entitled to more than two shares, and two, at
least, must be conversant with the Indian trade.
Annually a general meeting of the Company
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
was to be held at the Columbia River, at which
absent members might be represented and, under
certain specified conditions, might vote by proxy.
The association was to continue twenty years if
successful; should it be found unprofitable, however,
the parties concerned had full power to dissolve
it at the end of the first five years. For this
trial period of five years Mr. Astor volunteered
to bear all losses incurred, after which they were
to be borne by the partners proportionally to the
number of shares they held. Wilson Price Hunt
was chosen to act as agent for the Company for
a term of five years. He was to reside at the
principal establishment on the West coast; should
the interests of the association at any time require
his absence from this post, a person was to be
appointed in general meeting to take his place.</p>

<p>The two campaigns now inaugurated, one by
land and one by sea, aimed at the coveted point
on the Pacific Coast. The "Tonquin" was fitted
out in September, 1810, and sent under Captain
Thorn around Cape Horn, and Hunt was sent
from Montreal with the land expedition. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
"Tonquin" arrived at the mouth of the Columbia
March 22, 1811, and on April 12 the little
settlement, appropriately named Astoria, was
founded on Point George. In the race for
the Columbia the Americans had beaten the
Canadians.</p>

<p>Hunt had gone to Montreal in July, 1810,
and, setting out from that point by way of the
Ottawa, reached Mackinaw July 22. Having
remained at this point nearly three weeks, he
reached St. Louis by way of the Green Bay route
on September 3. The party was not on its way
again until October 21, and it wintered at the
mouth of the Nodowa on the Missouri, four hundred
and fifty miles from its mouth. Proceeding
westward in April, the party gained the Columbia
on the 21st of January, 1812, after a terrible
journey, and on the fifteenth of February
Astoria was reached.</p>

<p>Astor's great plan was now well under way
toward successful operation; the promoter could
not know for many days the fate of either
the "Tonquin" or the overland expedition. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
his resolute persistence never wavered; he fitted
out a second ship, the "Beaver," which sailed
October 10, 1811, for the Sandwich Islands and
the Columbia. The months dragged on; there
came no word from the "Tonquin"; no word
from Hunt or Astoria; no word from the
"Beaver"; thousands of dollars had been invested,
and no hint was received concerning its
safety, to say nothing of profit. Rumors of the
hostility of the Northwest Company were circulated,
and of their appeal to the British Government,
protesting against the operation of this
American fur company.</p>

<p>Then came the War of 1812, and the darkest
days for the promoter of Astoria. In 1813,
despite the lack of all good news, Astor fitted
out a third ship, and the "Lark" sailed from
New York March 6, 1813. The ship had been
gone only two weeks when news came justifying
Astor's fears for the safety of his Pacific colony.
A second appeal of the Northwest Company to
the British Government had gained the ear of
the ministry, and a frigate was ordered to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
mouth of the Columbia to destroy any American
settlement there and raise the British flag over
the ruins. Astor appealed to the American Government
for assistance; the frigate "Adams"
was detailed to protect American interests on
the Pacific. Astor fitted out a fourth ship, the
"Enterprise," which was to accompany the
"Adams." Now by way of St. Louis came
the news of the safe arrival of both Hunt and
the "Beaver" at Astoria, and of the successful
formation of that settlement. Hope was high,
and Astor said, "I felt ready to fall upon my
knees in a transport of gratitude." Dark news
came quickly upon the heels of the good. The
crew of the "Adams" was needed on the Great
Lakes, and the ship could not go to the Pacific.
Astor's hopes fell, but he determined to send the
"Enterprise" alone. Then the British blockaded
New York, and the last hope of giving help to
Astoria was lost. By the "Lark" Astor sent
directions to Hunt to guard against British surprise.
"Were I on the spot," he wrote with fire,
"and had the management of affairs, I would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
defy them all; but, as it is, everything depends
upon you and your friends about you. Our
enterprise is grand, and deserves success, and
I hope in God it will meet it. If my object was
merely gain of money, I should say, 'Think
whether it is best to save what we can, and
abandon the place; but the very idea is like a
dagger to my heart.'"</p>

<p>The fate of Astoria is well known; McDougal,
Astor's agent, fearing the arrival of a British
man-of-war, capitulated, on poor financial terms,
to agents of the Northwest Company, which
was in occupation when the British sloop-of-war
"Raccoon" arrived, November 30. On
December 12 Captain Block with his officers
entered the fort, and, breaking a bottle of wine,
took possession in the name of his Britannic
Majesty.</p>

<p>The failure of Astoria did not by any means
ruin its sturdy promoter, though it meant a great
monetary loss. Astor's fortune kept swelling
with the years until it reached twenty millions;
portions of it are of daily benefit to many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
thousands of his countrymen in such public gifts
as the Astor Library.</p>

<p>But these material benefits never did a greater
good than the influence Astor exerted in turning
the minds and hearts of men to the Northwest.
In many of our stories of early American promotion
the particular end in view was never
achieved. No hope of Washington's (after his
desire for independence) was more vital than his
hope of a canal between the Potomac and the
Ohio. The plan was not realized, yet through
his hoping for it and advocating it both the East
and the West received lasting benefits. But of
the stories of broken dreams, that of Astoria
stands alone and in many ways unsurpassed.
The indomitable spirit which Astor showed has
been the making of America. The risks he ran
fired him to heartier endeavor, as similar risks
have incited hundreds of American promoters
since his day; he stands, in failure and in success,
as the early type of the American promoter and
successful merchant prince.</p>

is probably
not another
example
of the springing
to life of the
seeds of Christianity
more interesting
than
in the case of
the Lewis and
Clark expedition
into that
far country
where rolls the Oregon. To what extent the scattering
of this seed was performed with any serious
expectation of success is not to be discovered;
but it seems that wherever that strange-looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
band of explorers and scientists fared and was
remembered by the aborigines that came under
its influence, so widely had there gone the legend
of the white man's Saviour. The Indians heard
that the white man had a "Book from Heaven"
which told them the way to walk in order to know
happiness and reach the happy hunting-grounds;
with this race, which lived forever on the verge
of starvation, the expression "happy hunting
grounds"&mdash;land where there was always game
to be obtained&mdash;meant far more than the hackneyed
expression does to us to-day. A book giving
explicit directions for reaching a place where
there was always something to eat was a thing
to be sought for desperately and long; they did
not appreciate the argument, once advanced with
no little acumen by a Wyandot Indian, that,
since the Indian knew neither the art of writing
nor that of book-making, the Great Spirit could
never have meant them to find the way of life
in a book. On the contrary, these western
Indians&mdash;Flatheads and Nez PercÃ©s&mdash;held a
great meeting, probably in the early Spring of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
1832, and appointed two old men and two young
men to go back and visit their "Father," General
Clark, at St. Louis.</p>

<p>"I came to you," one of them is reported to
have said to Clark when at last they reached
St. Louis, "over a trail of many moons from the
setting sun. You were the friend of my fathers,
who have all gone the long way. I came with
one eye partly open, for more light for my people
who sit in darkness.... I am going back the
long, sad trail to my people of the dark land.
You make my feet heavy with burdens of gifts,
and my moccasins will grow old in carrying them,
but the Book is not among them. When I tell
my poor blind people, after one more snow, in
the Big Council, that I did not bring the Book,
no word will be spoken by our old men or by our
young braves. One by one they will rise up and
go out in silence. My people will die in darkness,
and they will go on the long path to the other
hunting ground. No white men will go with
them and no white man's Book to make the way
plain." Two of the four Indians died in St.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
Louis, and the surviving two went West in the
same caravan with George Catlin, the famous
portrait painter, who included their portraits, it
is said, in his collection,&mdash;Numbers 207 and 209
in the Catlin Collection of the Smithsonian
Institution.</p>

<p>The first missionary effort in the Far West
was put forth by the Methodist General Conference,
which sent the Rev. Jason Lee westward,
starting overland from Fort Independence in
April, 1834. The mission was located seventy
miles up the Willamette River, and, singularly
enough, the Nez PercÃ©s, who had sent emissaries
to the "men near to God," who had the "Book
from Heaven," were passed by.</p>

<p>In the Spring of the same year the American
Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions,
including then both Congregationalists and Presbyterians,
became interested in the new field for
explorers and in this strange call that had come
ringing across the vast prairies and rugged
mountains of the unknown West, as, in a previous
study, we have noticed that the Moravian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
Brethren became interested in the call that came
half a century before across the Alleghanies
from the Delawares on the Muskingum. Nor
was the David Zeisberger, fearless, patient, and
devoted, found to be wanting in the present instance,
for the call came through a channel now
difficult to trace to a young man who was able
to endure and dare.</p>

<p>Two years after the beginning of the nineteenth
century Marcus Whitman was born at
Rushville, New York, of New England parentage,
strong both morally and intellectually.
His early life was spent in a typical pioneer
home, where he knew the toil, the weariness, and
the hearty humble joys of that era,&mdash;a home
in which independence and general strength of
character were formed and confirmed. The loss
of his father when he was at the age of eight
laid upon the shoulders of the growing lad
responsibilities which made him old beyond his
years. All this certainly had its part in preparing
him for the sublimely humble work, as
it seemed, that he was to be called upon to do;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
and little could he have known that there were
to come those days of agony and exhaustion
which demanded all his latent accumulation of
iron strength and courage of steel,&mdash;days that
would demand all his stores of resourceful foresight.
Whitman's education was probably indifferent,&mdash;at
least it was not above the average
of the day. Converted at the age of seventeen,
he did not join a church until he was twenty-two,
which may be taken as showing the reticent
or, rather, unobtrusive character of the man. An
early purpose to prepare for the ministry was
thwarted by physical weakness, and the young
man proceeded to study medicine in the Berkshire
Medical College at Pittsfield, Massachusetts.
The first years of practice were spent in
Canada; returning then to New York, his attention
was unexpectedly absorbed in a business
venture with his brother in a sawmill. How
difficult it must have been for any one to read
this leading aright, so seemingly adverse was it
to the prescribed course that was customary
among practitioners. Yet the same knowledge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
of business, perhaps, would not have come
to Whitman in any other way, and it was
providentially to stand him in good stead.</p>

<p class="bq">"Dr. Whitman was a strong man, earnest, decided,
aggressive. He was sincere and kind, generous to a
fault.... He was fearless of danger, strong in purpose,
resolute and unflinching in the face of difficulties.
At times he became animated and earnest in argument
or conversation, but in general he would be called a
man of reticence. He was above medium height, rather
spare than otherwise, had deep blue eyes, a large
mouth, and, in middle life, hair that would be called
iron-gray."</p>

<p>Of Miss Prentiss of Prattsburg, New York,
who soon became Mrs. Whitman, Mrs. Martha
J. Lamb has said:</p>

<p class="bq">"She was a graceful blonde, stately and dignified in
her bearing, without a particle of affectation. When
he was preparing to leave for Oregon, the church held
a farewell service and the minister gave out the
well-known hymn:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse">Yes, my native land, I love thee,</div>
    <div class="tb">&#8226;  &#8226;  &#8226;  &#8226;  &#8226; &#8226;</div>
    <div class="verse">Can I bid you all farewell?</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>

<p class="bq">The whole congregation joined heartily in the singing,
but before the hymn was half through, one by one
they ceased singing, and audible sobs were heard in
every part of the great audience. The last stanza
was sung by the sweet voice of Mrs. Whitman alone,
clear, musical, and unwavering."</p>

<p>Whitman's first Western trip was a hurried
tour of observation made in company with the
Rev. Samuel Parker, a graduate of Williams.
Leaving St. Louis in the Spring of 1835, they
reached the country of the Nez PercÃ©s and Flatheads
in August. It is interesting to note that
these men crossed the Great Divide by way of
the South Pass, concerning which Mr. Parker
made an astounding prophecy, as follows:</p>

<p class="bq">"Though there are some elevations and depressions
in this valley, yet, comparatively speaking, it is level,
and the summit, where the waters divide which flow into
the Atlantic and into the Pacific, is about six thousand
feet above the level of the ocean. There would be no
difficulty in the way of constructing a railroad from
the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. There is no greater
difficulty in the whole distance than has already been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
overcome in passing the Green Mountains between
Boston and Albany; and probably the time may not
be far distant when trips will be made across the continent,
as they have been made to the Niagara Falls,
to see Nature's wonders."</p>

<p>The interviews with the Indians were uniform
in character, and showed that the missionaries
would receive hospitality at the hands of the
Nez PercÃ©s and Flatheads. Wrote Mr. Parker:</p>

<p class="bq">"We laid before them the object of our appointment,
and explained to them the benevolent desires of Christians
concerning them. We then inquired whether they
wished to have teachers come among them, and instruct
them in the knowledge of God, His worship, and the
way to be saved; and what they would do to aid them
in their labors. The oldest chief arose, and said he
was old, and did not expect to know much more; he
was deaf and could not hear, but his heart was made
glad, very glad, to see what he had never seen before, a
man near to God,&mdash;meaning a minister of the Gospel."</p>

<p>It took only ten days in the country of the
Indians to assure the men of the rich promise
offered by the field; whereupon Dr. Whitman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
turned his face eastward, to make his report
and be ready in the following Spring to return
with reÃ«nforcements with a caravan of the
American Fur Company. A great enthusiasm
had seized him. He wrote to Miss Prentiss,</p>

<p class="bq">"I have a strong desire for that field of labor....
I feel greatly encouraged to go on in every sense,
only, I feel my unfitness for the work; but I know in
whom I have trusted, and with whom are the fountains
of wisdom.... You need not be anxious especially
for your health or safety, but for your usefulness to
the cause of Missions and the souls of our benighted
fellow-men."</p>

<p>Dr. Whitman was married early in 1836,
and the couple were driven by sleigh from
Elmira, New York, to Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania,
where they took a canal-boat over the
Alleghany Portage Railway on their way westward.
Their principal companions were the Rev.
Henry H. Spaulding, a graduate of Western
Reserve College,&mdash;two or three years Whitman's
junior,&mdash;and wife, and Mr. William H.
Gray; there were also two teamsters and two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
Indian boys, whom Dr. Whitman had brought
East with him. Joining the caravan of the
American Fur Company at Council Bluffs, they
reached Fort Laramie early in June, and the
South Pass on the following Fourth of July,
where six years later Fremont raised an American
flag and gained the immortal name of
"Pathfinder."</p>

<p>It is difficult to emphasize sufficiently the historic
importance and significance of the advent
of these women into the country beyond the
Great Divide in Whitman's light wagon and
cart; true, Ashley, Bridger, and Bonneville had
taken wagons into the Rockies and left them
there, but it was for this sturdy and determined
physician to take a woman across the mountains
in 1836, showing at once the practicability of a
wagon road from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
But the wagon seemed hardly less wonderful
than the patient women in it. Rough mountaineers
who had come to the rendezvous of the
American Fur Company just westward of the
"divide" were dumbfounded at the sight of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
the first white women on whom they had laid eyes
since they had reached the States; tears came
to the eyes of some of them as they shook hands
with the first white women that ever crossed the
Rocky Mountains; Mrs. Spaulding had been
very ill, and the rough devotion of these men
and their Indian wives gave her new hope and
courage for the work. On the other hand,
"From that day," one of these men said, "I
was a better man." But it was for an old trapper
to see the real national significance of the
advent of these women into that far-flung
country. "There," he said, pointing to the
women, "is something which the honorable
Hudson Bay Company cannot get rid of. They
cannot send these women out of the country.
They had come to stay."</p>

<p>Dr. Whitman chose his station at Waiilatpu,
near Walla Walla, Washington, while Spaulding
went a hundred miles and more eastward
among the Nez PercÃ©s of the Clearwater Valley.
A quart of wheat brought with them, cherished
as were the twelve potatoes brought around
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
Cape Horn by the pioneers of Astoria a quarter
of a century before, was planted amid hopes
and fears, and yielded, in less than a dozen
years, nearly thirty thousand bushels in a season.
Their few cows multiplied to a herd;
gardens and orchards were laid out; a printing
press and sheep were secured from the Hawaiian
Islands, and upon the press was printed a code
of laws, differing in no great degree from those
issued in Zeisberger's sweet "Meadow of Light"
on the Muskingum half a century before. Mrs.
Spaulding's school numbered five hundred pupils,
and a church had grown to a membership of
one hundred.</p>

<p>It is not possible here to trace with faithfulness
the brave successes now achieved, for we
are seeking but one of the many lessons to be
found in the Whitman story. There was labor
and success for all, and trial for all as well;
there were some differences of opinion among
the workers, to be settled as the field grew large,
for these men were independent thinkers, each
one a man among his fellows. And then there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
was the rivalry with the missionaries to the
northward, the Catholic priests located at Vancouver
and extending their influence wherever
the Hudson Bay Company, in turn, extended
its interests. The priests, it should be observed,
had been called in by the Company to take the
place of the missionary of the Church of England,
whom the Company had sent home. We
cannot discuss here the tangled Oregon question
and the tactics of America's rivals for that
beautiful stretch of country. Two things stand
fairly plain in it all: to be held, Oregon must
have a strong American quota of settlers, and
these missionaries were on the ground when the
matter was precipitated.</p>

<p>The conquest of Oregon was to be made, if
made at all, at the hands of an army of men
with broadaxes on their shoulders; not elsewhere
in our national annals does this appear more
clearly than in the case of Oregon. In the military
sense there was no conquest to be effected;
an enterprising fur company, controlled by men
of principle but served by perfectly unprincipled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
agents, sought the land for its wealth of skins,
and would not have wished it "opened," in
any sense, to the world. The case is quite
parallel to the attitude of England at the close
of the Old French War, described on a previous
page<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>;
the proclamation of 1763, permitting
no pioneer to erect a cabin beyond the
head-springs of the Atlantic rivers, because, if
populated, the land would not pour its treasures
into the coffers of a spendthrift king, was
as idle a selfish dream as was ever conceived with
reference to Oregon by a Hudson Bay Company's
<i>engagÃ©</i>. In the case of no other distinct
region in our entire domain, perhaps, was it
equally plain that the first people to really occupy
would be, in all likelihood, the people that
would control and at last possess it. It was like
so many early military campaigns in America,
as, for instance, Forbes's march on Fort Duquesne
and Clark's advance to Vincennes,&mdash;to
reach the destination was of itself the chief
hardship; for if in the case of Forbes that great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
army could be once thrown across the Alleghanies
where lay Braddock's mouldering bones,
the capitulation of Fort Duquesne would be but
a commonplace consequent.</p>

<p>What might have been the result had not this
fragile missionary movement into the empire of
Oregon (including, of course, Oregon, Washington,
Idaho, and parts of Montana and Wyoming)
taken place cannot now be determined,
but the rival interests were hurrying emigrants
from Red River and from Canada in the full
belief that to hold would mean to have. A
counter action was that put forth by the American
missionaries of all denominations in Oregon,
chief of whom was Marcus Whitman. It seems
as though some writers have believed that there
can be a line drawn between what these first
Americans did to promote missionary success and
that done to advance what may be called American
political interests in Oregon; to the present
writer this seems impossible. What helped the
one helped the other, whether the motive comprehended
the larger interests at stake or not.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
That the missionaries desired that the Americans
coming into Oregon should be men of sobriety
and character should not in the least argue that
they did not desire them at the same time to be
good patriotic citizens, eager for their country's
welfare. It is hardly fair to imply that these
men were poor patriots in proportion as they
were good missionaries; nor can the proposition
be more reasonably entertained that these brave
men desired to promote emigration thither in
order to secure more assistance or success in the
missionary work in which they were engaged.
In all these considerations the hope of missionary
success was inextricably bound up with national
extension and national growth. Were the
mission stations to be increased, it was of national
moment; were they to be decreased, it was
an ominous sign so far as possible American
dominion was concerned.</p>

<p>Unfortunate internal trouble among the missionaries,
due to differences of opinion on policies
and ways and means, caused the American
Board to decide to eliminate a portion of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
mission stations. Just what steps were to be
taken is not important to us here; the important
thing is the influence of this curtailing of the
work of the American missionary. Was it to
strengthen or weaken America's claim to the
empire of Oregon? Was it to hinder or help
the occupation of the land on the part of rival
spirits? Those who might hold that the question
was one of missionary policy totally apart from
national politics take a view of the matter in
which the present writer cannot share. These
men were Americans; it is difficult to believe
that with the Oregon question to the front these
missionaries (who were on the spot) confined
their attention solely to the missionary problem
heedless of the national problem, which must
have embraced and included all others in any
analysis.</p>

<p>The missionaries met to consider the order of
the American Board late in the Fall of 1842.
Marcus Whitman was granted leave of absence
to visit the East and persuade the officers of
the Board to rescind their action. Wrote one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
of the missionaries of the Board immediately
after Whitman's departure concerning his
plan:</p>

<p class="bq">"I have no doubt that if his plan succeeds it will be
one of great good to the mission and country. It is to
be expected that a Romish influence will come in....
To meet this influence a few religious settlers around a
station would be invaluable."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>This contemporary document, written just as
Whitman was leaving, ought to be good evidence,
first, that he had a definite errand, and,
secondly, that it concerned new emigrants.</p>

<p>The friends of Whitman have gone very far
in an attempt to maintain that he left Oregon
hurriedly on the brave ride he now undertook
in order to reach Washington in time to accomplish
a specific political errand; if nothing more,
such a sweeping assertion was sure to be called
into question, and when this was done the querists
were likely to be unable to keep from going to
the other extreme of denying that Whitman ever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
went to Washington or had any political motive
in coming East.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>A brief but careful view of the documents
in the case has inclined us to the view that
Whitman came East as he did in order to be
in time to have a part in arousing interest in
and directing the course of the large emigration
that it was felt would turn toward Oregon
in the Spring of 1843. We are the more inclined
to this opinion for the reason that this was the
most important thing by far that could have
occupied the man's mind, however one views the
question; what could more have benefited the
mission cause than a flood-tide of American
pioneers into Oregon with axes to sing that old
home-loving song sung long ago in the Alleghanies,
in Ohio, in Kentucky, and beyond?
And what more, pray, could be done than this
to advance the interests of the United States
hereabouts? In point of fact the nation had depended
on the conquest of Oregon by pioneers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
if it was to be conquered at all; treaties could
be made and broken, but a conquest by the axe-bearing
army would be final.</p>

<p>"The policy," writes Justin Winsor, "which
the United States soon after developed was one
in which Great Britain could hardly compete,
and this was to possess the [Oregon] country
by settlers as against the nominal occupancy of
the fur-trading company directed from Montreal.
By 1832 this movement of occupation
was fully in progress. By 1838 the interest was
renewed in Congress, and a leading and ardent
advocate of the American rights, Congressman
Linn of Missouri, presented a report to the
Senate and a bill for the occupation of Oregon,
June 6, 1838. A report by Caleb Cushing coming
from the Committee on Foreign Affairs
respecting the Territory of Oregon, accompanied
by a map, was presented in January and February
in 1839:</p>

<p class="bq">"'It was not till 1842 that the movements of aggression
began to become prominent in politics, and immigration
was soon assisted by Fremont's discovery of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
the pass over the Rocky Mountains at the head of the
La Platte.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
Calhoun in 1845 took the position that the
tide of immigration was solving the difficulty and it
was best to wait that issue and not force a conflict.'"</p>

<p>It seems perfectly certain that Whitman was
concerned especially with this "tide of immigration."
He left home October 3; in eleven
days Fort Hall was reached, four hundred miles
away. Finding it best, he struck southward on
the old Santa FÃ© Trail, by way of Fort Wintah,
Fort Uncompahgre, and Fort Taos. From
Santa FÃ© the course was in part by the old
Santa FÃ© Trail to Bent's Fort and Independence.
Bent's Fort was left January 7, 1843, but the
date of reaching Westport (Kansas City), Missouri,
is not definitely known; it was probably
the last of January, and here he was busy for
some little time helping to shape things up for
the much talked of emigration of 1843. Indeed,
there is evidence that he did not leave Westport
until at least the 15th of February. Possibly
it was here that he prepared and published a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
pamphlet describing Oregon, the soil, climate,
and its desirableness for American colonists, and
said that "he had crossed the Rocky Mountains
that winter principally to take back that season
a train of wagons to Oregon." The Doctor
assured his countrymen that wagons could be
taken to the Columbia River. "It was this
assurance of the missionary," wrote one emigrant,
"that induced my father and several of
his neighbors to sell out and start at once for
this country."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>If this line of investigation is followed steadily
with reference to Dr. Whitman's Eastern visit,
the result is eminently satisfactory from any
point of view. It is well and good to believe
that he attempted to right the minds of some
eminent men on the Oregon question, but he
probably accomplished more by some plain talks
with a score of frontiersmen at Westport and by
his pamphlet on the subject than by visiting ten
thousand men in high authority. What was to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
save Oregon was the emigration movement,&mdash;the
rank and file of the army with the broadaxe,&mdash;not
Whitman or Webster or a President or
a congressman or a hundred congressmen. This
Oregon missionary was a plain, straightforward,
brave, modest man, not seeking notoriety, come
eastward to have a part in inducing emigration
that must start, if at all, <i>in the Spring months</i>.
There you have an explanation for the Winter's
ride.</p>

<p>Pressing on eastward, Whitman went to
Washington; this has been questioned because
none of the public prints of the city noised
abroad his coming or his presence. This proves he
was not there as much as the absence of his foot-prints
on those streets to-day proves it; so far as
it indicates anything, it only shows the man was
not seeking notoriety and cheap advertisement.
A year afterwards, in June, 1844, the Hon.
James M. Porter, Secretary of War, received a
letter from Marcus Whitman which began,
"In compliance with the request you did me
the honor to make last winter, while in Washington,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
I herewith transmit to you the synopsis
of a bill." Another sentence runs, "I have,
since our interview, been," etc.,
<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> making, in all,
two definite statements in his own hand to the
effect that Whitman visited the Secretary of
War in Washington, and that while there he
talked with the Secretary of War concerning the
national character of the Oregon movement.
Any who might incline to the view that Whitman
came East solely on a mission errand must
pay small attention to this letter, which proves
that the Secretary of War and Whitman must
have talked of a bill relative to Oregon emigration.
Whitman certainly conversed with Porter
along the lines of their subsequent correspondence,
which resulted in the missionary's sending
in a bill authorizing the President of the United
States to establish a line of</p>

<p class="bq">"agricultural posts or farming stations, extending at
intervals from the present and most usual crossing of
the Kansas River, west of the western boundary of the
State of Missouri, thence ascending the Platte River
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
on the southern border, thence through the valley of
the Sweetwater to Fort Hall, and thence to settlements
of the Willamette in the Territory of Oregon. Which
said posts will have for their object to set examples of
civilized industry to the several Indian tribes, to keep
them in proper subjection to the laws of the United
States, to suppress violent and lawless acts along the
said line of the frontier, to facilitate the passage of
troops and munitions of war into and out of the said
Territory of Oregon, and the transportation of the mail
as hereinafter provided."</p>

<p>Whitman reached Boston probably March 30.
There seems to be no question that his chief
errand here with the officers of the American
Board was to interest them in a plan to induce
emigration for the sake of preserving the missions.
On his return to Oregon he wrote Secretary
Greene of the Board:</p>

<p class="bq">"A [Catholic] bishop is set over this part of the
work, whose seat, as the name indicates, will be at
Walla Walla. He, I understand, is styled Bishop
of Walla Walla. It will be well for you to know that
from what we can learn, their object will be to colonize
around them. I cannot blame myself that the plan I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
laid down when I was in Boston was not carried out.
If we could have had good families, say two and three
together, to have placed in select spots among the
Indians, the present crisis, which I feared, would not
have come. Two things, and it is true those which were
the most important, were accomplished by my return
to the States. By means of the establishment of the
wagon road, which is due to that effort alone, the
immigration was secured and saved from disaster in
the Fall of forty-three. Upon that event the present
acquired rights of the U. States by her citizens hung.
And not less certain is it that upon the result of
immigration to this country the present existence of
this mission and of Protestantism in general hung also.
It is a matter of surprise to me that so few pious men
are ready to associate together and come to this country,
when they could be so useful in setting up and
maintaining religious society and establishing the means
of education. It is indeed so that some of the good
people of the East can come to Oregon for the double
purpose of availing themselves of the Government
bounty of land and of doing good to the country."</p>

<p>This quotation undoubtedly contains in outline
the fundamental purpose of Dr. Whitman's
journey eastward through the Winter's snows;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
the American missions in Oregon were evidently
on the point of being actually crowded out by
the threatened emigrants from the North; to
hold the ground gained, a rival emigration from
the States was an imperative necessity, and that
was the thing for which Whitman was working.
So closely bound were the real interests, then,
of the missions and the territorial interests of the
United States, that for one to attempt a technical
separation is to do an injustice to both.
Read as widely as you will the few manuscripts
left us in Dr. Whitman's hand, and the impression
grows stronger with each word that the
man was exceptionally clear-sighted and sane;
and while a great deal of nonsense is and has
been put into circulation about him, so far as
Whitman himself is concerned we find his attention
given to roads and trails, forage and provisions,
axle grease and water; in all he wrote
(and there is sufficient for a very fair guess
at his purpose and plans) we find almost no reference
whatever to the greater national work
which he was actually doing,&mdash;a fact that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
cannot but be forever enjoyed by those to whom
his splendid life work will appeal.</p>

<p>On May 12 Whitman was again in St. Louis
writing Secretary Greene, "I hope no time will
be lost in seizing every favorable means of inducing
good men to favor the interest of the Oregon."
We should say here that, while in Boston,
Whitman induced the officers of the American
Board to rescind their action abolishing certain
of the mission stations in Oregon. Now once
more on the frontier, Whitman found that his
hope of a large American emigration to Oregon
was in a fair way of being realized; as George
Rogers Clark came back to Virginia from Kentucky
at an opportune moment to urge Patrick
Henry to authorize the far-famed Illinois campaign,
so now Marcus Whitman had come East
at an opportune moment to add what weight he
could in the interests of an Oregon campaign.
But as in the case of Clark's visit to Virginia, so
now, far more important causes had been at work
to bring the desired result than the mere coming
of a messenger. It would indeed be impossible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
to estimate the large number of forces that
had been at work to bring about the famous emigration
of 1843, but among them should be remembered
the long debates in Congress on the
Ashburton Treaty, the Linn Bill concerning
Oregon lands, Greenhow's "Memoir," and Lieutenant
Wilkes's report, as well as the missionary
efforts of the various denominations, and the
Whitman pamphlet, before referred to.</p>

<p>As a result, as singular and interesting an army
as ever bore the broadaxe westward now began
to rendezvous in May near Independence, Kansas,
just beyond the Missouri line. It would
probably have gathered there to go forth to its
brave conquest though there had been no Marcus
Whitman or Daniel Webster, or any other man
or set of men that ever lived; the saying that
Whitman "saved Oregon" is just as false as
the saying that Washington was the "Father of
his Country," or that Thomas was the "Rock
of Chickamauga," or Webster the "Defender of
the Constitution"&mdash;and just as true; it is a
boast, a toast, an idle fable to those who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
disbelieve it, a precious legend of heroism and
magnetism to those who glory in it. On the
18th of May a committee of the emigrants was
appointed to go to Independence and inquire of
Whitman concerning the "practicability of the
road," as one of the party (George Wilkes)
wrote; another pioneer (Peter H. Burnett) said
that on the twentieth he attended a meeting with
Colonels Thornton and Bartleson, Mr. Rickman
and Dr. Whitman, at which meeting rules
and regulations for the "Oregon Emigrating
Society" were adopted. There is no doubt that
Whitman's advice was of considerable importance.
Any man who had taken a wagon over
the Rockies would have been of prime importance
to these emigrants, irrespective of any other
considerations. On the 22d of May the vanguard
of the army started, with John Gant as
guide, and the Kansas River was reached on
the 26th, and wholly crossed on the last day
of May. On the 30th of May we find him
writing to Secretary Greene in the following
strain:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>

<p class="bq">"You will be surprised to see that we are not yet
started. Lieutenant Fremont left this morning. The
emigrants have some of them just gone, and others have
been gone a week, and some are yet coming on. I shall
start to-morrow. I regret I could not have spent some
of the time spent here in suspense with my friends at
the East.</p>

<p class="bq">"I have only a lad of thirteen, my nephew, with me.
I take him to have some one to stay with Mrs. Whitman.
I cannot give you much of an account of the emigrants
until we get on the road. It is said that there are over
two hundred men besides women and children. They
look like a fair representative of a country population.
Few, I conclude, are pious. Fremont intends to return
by land, so as to be back early in winter. Should he
succeed in doing so we may be able to send you an
account of the Mission and country at that time. We
do not ask you to become the patrons of emigration to
Oregon, but we desire you to use your influence that, in
connection with all the influx into the country, there
may be a fair proportion of good men of our own
denomination who shall avail themselves of the advantages
of the country in common with others. Also that
ministers should come out as citizens or under the Home
Missionary Society. We think agents of the Board and
of the Home Missionary Society, as also ministers and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
good men in general, may do much to send a share of
good, pious people to that country. We cannot feel
it to be at all just that we do nothing, while worldly
men and Papists are doing so much.... I wish to say
a few words about manufactures in Oregon, that I
may remove an impression that they cannot compete
with the English. First, let us take the operatives and
the raw material from the Pacific Islands. It matters
not at how much labor the Islander cleans the cotton,
for it gives him employment, and for that he gets goods,
and then for his coffee and sugar and salt and cotton,
etc., etc., he gets goods also. This is all an exchange
trade that only a population and manufacturers in
Oregon can take advantage of, because they alone will
want the articles of exchange which the Islander can
give. The same will hold good in relation to Indians
whenever they shall have sheep, and I intend to try and
have the Government give them sheep instead of money,
a result not likely to be delayed long. A good man
or company can now select the best mill sites and spots,
and likely would find a sawmill profitable at once. I
think our greatest hope for having Oregon at least part
Protestant now lies in encouraging a proper intention
of good men to go there while the country is open. I
want to call your attention to the operation of Farnham
of Salem and the Bensons of New York in Oregon. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
am told credibly that secretly Government aids them with
the secret service fund. Captain Howard of Maine is
also in expectation of being employed by Government to
take out emigrants by ship should the Oregon Bill pass."</p>

<p>Those who love the memory of this brave
missionary must hold this letter exceedingly
precious; it has, in addition to its enthusiasm
and patriotism, that sane and practical outlook
on the future that pervades so much of Washington's
writings, especially the letters to William
Crawford. Here is another man looking,
on the Pacific slope, for such important commonplace
things as mill sites in 1843, just as
Washington was looking for mill sites in the
Ohio Valley in 1770, and between the two it
would be difficult to say which was the more
seriously optimistic, though the influence of both
must have been strong, in their respective days,
on the advancing pioneer.</p>

<p>For all the daring of the hardy Winter's
journey that Whitman made<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> we look upon this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
other journey, with this splendid army of nearly
a thousand Oregon pioneers and home-builders,
as the one of supremest importance. Ay, here
was Whitman's Ride,&mdash;not sung, perhaps, so
widely as the one in the Winter's snows, and
yet the one ride which Oregon could not have
missed, and the one she can never forget! Let
the fruitless debate go on as to the exact measure
of this unpretentious missionary's influence
in shaping Government policies and moulding
public opinion; it is enough for me to know
that he viewed the whole question as keenly as
his few letters prove he unquestionably did, and
then to know that when the great emigration
started he was there to direct and inspire; that
he could do the humblest duty and say the least
about it, and at the same time show Fremont
where to go if he would gain the immortal title
of "Pathfinder."</p>

<p>Whitman has suffered at the hands of his
friends, who have been over-jealous touching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
matters concerning which his own lovable modesty
and reticence would not allow him to speak; they
have made claims and inferences unwarranted by
the known facts of the case. His Winter's ride
has been compared with Sheridan's from Winchester,
and tasted no better in some mouths than
does the ballad of Sheridan's Ride in the mouths
of Crook's men, who knew their leader had, an
hour back, given and carried out the order Sheridan
is said (in the poem) to have given when he
dashed upon the scene, when, in fact, he merely
came to Crook and asked him what he had done.
<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
And yet Reid's poem is as true to the spirit of
the indomitable Sheridan as Butterfield's is true
of Whitman.</p>

<p>We have compared Whitman on the Walla
Walla to Zeisberger on the Muskingum; and
the terrible massacre of November 29, 1847,
in which the brave hero of Oregon, with his
wife and twelve others, gave their lives, belongs
in history with the awful GnadenhÃ¼tten
tragedy. The murder of these brave pioneers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
by Indians, to whom they had given the best
of their lives and all their strength and prayers,
is quite as fiendishly incongruous as the destruction
of the Moravian band of corn-huskers
by frenzied Monongahela frontiersmen; in
each case the murderers knew not what they
did.</p>

<p>But Whitman's work was done, for we have
it in his own hand that he would be contented if
posterity would remember, not that he had influenced
a President or a Congress or saved an
Empire, but merely, as he wrote, that he was</p>

<p class="bq">"one of the first to take white women across the
mountains and prevent the disaster and reaction which
would have occurred by the breaking up of the present
emigration, and establishing the first wagon road across
to the border of the Columbia."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>And yet when you study this boast you will
find that it contains in its essence all that any
boast for Whitman could hold; for it was an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
army of axe-bearers that was to save Oregon;
and if Meade won Gettysburg or Wolfe captured
Quebec, then Whitman and the Americans who
went in his track won for America the northern
Pacific slope.</p>

against all opposition, great measures that we
see now were of tremendous advantage; if the
position was abdicated by one man it was filled
by another; and so down through the century
and a quarter of our national existence there has
been a power at work in our councils that has
been optimistic, and at the same time true to
the genius of America's geographical position
and her high calling among the nations of the
earth. It is not because this has been marvellously
illustrated since the outbreak of the Spanish-American
War that reference is made to it here,
though the illustration is apposite and fair;
but if we look back down the decades from the
day that Congress signed that contract with
Rufus Putnam and his Revolutionary patriots,
or the day when Jefferson dared to effect the
Louisiana Purchase, we shall continually find men
sitting in the Congressional seats at the capital
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
who had the courage to try new paths, to assume
common-sense views of the Constitution,
and who believed in their country and wished to
see it shirk no great responsibility. Such men
as these were as truly captains of our expansion
as was Putnam or Henderson or Astor.</p>

<p>The age in our history to which our attention
is turned on this subject is more particularly
that lying between the beginning of the second
and the ending of the third decade of last
century. Much that was proposed before the
opening of the nineteenth century, in the way of
material national advance, was forgotten in the
taxing days of 1811-1815. Chief among these
was the Erie Canal proposition, and it is perhaps
not too much to say that had the war with England
not come as it did, possibly the Government
would, by means of the money accruing
from the sale of Michigan lands, have invested
in the Erie Canal project; the Cumberland
Road was one of the great works that went on
despite the war. The moral effect of the victories
of Perry and Jackson, one to the north
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
and the other to the south, was very great; with
the triumphant ending of the war the little
victorious nation sprang into a strength and a
passion for power that well-nigh frightened
those acquainted with the policy and conservatism
of the ante-bellum days.</p>

<p>We have touched slightly on one of the great
questions of this most wonderful period of
American history, that of the constitutionality
of the appropriations for the Cumberland Road,
and Henry Clay's championship of the measure.
But this was only one of a score of propositions
in a campaign of internal improvements,
and Clay was but one of a hundred champions
who assisted a weak nation to take on the elements
of strength by encouraging agriculture
and manufactures, and binding a far-flung land
by means of communication and intercourse.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the second generation in
the century the problem of internal improvements
came to the fore as on no previous occasion,
backed by the strongest men then in the public
eye,&mdash;Clay, Calhoun, Adams, and Webster.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
The Cumberland Road had been making its way
westward, but had not yet thrown its tawny
length over the Ohio River and into the States
beyond. But the argument for this great national
work was not to be gainsaid, for the
original compact with Ohio had been reiterated
on the admission of Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri,
respectively, and a part of the sales of
the public lands in those States was already
pledged to this object. As one of the fruits
of the much discussed "American System,"
championed by Henry Clay, the Cumberland
Road was a popular success, though there was
never a time when any measure concerning it
could not secure a strong following in the House
and the Senate.</p>

<p>The American System stood for a use of the
public surplus for works of internal improvement;
it was not a popular policy for a long
time, but while in vogue it was of immeasurable
benefit to the expanding country, its champions
being veritable captains of the country's advance.
The most interesting features of the history of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
this doctrine are the vehemence with which it
was advocated for a few critical years when
nothing else would have equally aided the national
advance, the questionable basis on which
the doctrine rested, and the readiness with which
it was abandoned when its providential mission
was effected. Even before the real internal
improvement era came it was foreshadowed by
the historic position of the two parties toward
the object, as shown in Cumberland Road legislation.
The bitterness of the struggle could not
be shown better than by the repudiations of
Congress in 1817 in its votes on this subject.
In that year Congress passed the following
inconsistent resolutions: (1) Congress has the
power to build public roads and military roads,
and to improve waterways; (2) Congress has
<i>not</i> power to construct post roads or military
roads; (3) Congress has <i>not</i> power to construct
roads or canals to carry commerce between the
States; (4) Congress has <i>not</i> power to construct
military roads. "Thus we see," said a triumphant
enemy of the so-called American System,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
"by the solemn decision of this House in 1817,
all power over this subject was repudiated in
every form and shape." Despite these inconsistencies
the movement was ever a forward movement,
until at last, in 1824, it assumed gigantic
proportions, alarming to some degree the very
men who had urged it forward.</p>

<p>The revenue of the Government at this time
was about twenty-five millions, and the running
expenses&mdash;including interest on the slight remaining
debt&mdash;about half that sum. To what
better use could the ten or twelve surplus
million dollars be devoted than to the internal
improvement of the land, as Gallatin and Jefferson
had advocated twenty years before? Here
the contest shifted to the tariff, a reduction of
which would do away with the necessity of finding
a way to employ a surplus. The drift of
public sentiment, however, was largely in favor
of turning the fostering care of the Government
to works of improvement, either by direct
appropriation, or by taking stock in local companies,
or by devoting to their use the proceeds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
of the sale of public lands; in any way the result
would be the same, and the nation as a whole
would feel the benefit.</p>

<p>The policy swept a large part of the country
like wildfire, and ten thousand dreams, many
of them chimerical to the last degree, were
conceived. As a rule the result was, without
question, bitter disappointment; but amid all
the dangers that were in the way, and all the
possibilities of untold harm, an influence was
put to work that did more for the awakening
of the young land than anything that had ever
preceded it. Over a hundred and twenty-five
claimants for national aid were considered by
squads of engineers sent out by the Government.
In the sarcastic words of one of the opposers of
the system (and on this subject there was a
chance for sarcasm that seldom came to Congressmen)
every creek and mill-race in the
United States was being surveyed by engineers
sent out by the chief executive. It was asserted,
and not without some plausibility, that such
surveying expeditions were used very craftily to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
influence votes, being sent to view rivers and
roads in disputed regions where the information
was circulated that, unless the champions of internal
improvement were put in power, great
local blessings would be lost to these districts.</p>

<p>But this was not by any means the chief danger
in the campaign. As was most forcefully
argued by the opposition, the influence of this
paternal policy on the part of the Government
would be to awaken hostility and set one part
of the nation against the other, for in no way
could the division of the surplus be made equal.
It could not be made on the basis of population
even if this were admitted to be constitutional,
for some parts of the country needed help far
more than others; a naturally impregnable harbor
did not need a fourth of the money expended
on it that a comparatively defenceless
harbor did. Again, the division could not, for
the same reason, be made on the basis of receipts;
the States of the seaboard, in which
the great part of the Government's revenue
was raised, would then be almost the only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
beneficiaries; the West would receive nothing.
The accusation of favoritism came with piercing
force. Suppose, for instance, New York and
Mississippi should come at the same time to
Congress, the one asking for the improvement
of the Erie Canal, and the other for the
improvement of the Mississippi River. Which
party would Congress listen to if the public
treasury was not in a position to satisfy
both applicants? It was urged that this procedure
destroyed the whole principle of representative
responsibility. Take the case of New
York and her great canal,&mdash;the most important
material improvement in the fifty years of the
nation's life; New York came to the Government
when the project was first broached, asking
for aid. The cause was a good one; in peace
it would be a benefit to at least six States, and
in war it would be a national advantage of untold
moment; in fact, as we have seen, the
possibility of another war with England along
the Lakes was the very argument that turned the
scale and caused the canal to be built. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
project was discouraged at Washington, and
not a cent of Government treasure went into the
undertaking. Why now, a score of years later,
should New York representatives vote money
from the national treasury for objects no less
national or needful than the Erie Canal? Several
neighboring States (Ohio, for instance) had
declined to invest funds in the Erie Canal venture
when it was first promoted; why now should
New York representatives vote national funds
(such a large part of which came from New
York ports) for improvements in these States,
whose delegates in Congress refused aid to the
Erie Canal in its dark hours? On the other hand
it was urged that even the Erie Canal, the most
famous work of internal improvement promoted
by any of the States, had done "nothing toward
the extinguishment of its debt," up to 1830; if
this great work did not reimburse the treasury
which built it, though operated by a purely local
authority well acquainted with all conditions and
able to take advantage of all circumstances, how
would it be with works promoted by the national
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
Government, in distant parts of the country,
with little or no knowledge of local circumstances
or conditions? Another argument, more powerful
than was realized at the time, was that which
prophesied the swift advance of the locomotive
and the railroad, and the consequent decay and
disuse of the common road and the canal. Said
a member of Congress in debate on the floor
of the House, "The honorable gentleman from
Virginia [Mr. Mercer, the father of the Chesapeake
and Ohio Canal], Sir, must hear the
appalling, the heartrending fact, that this
mighty monument [the Chesapeake and Ohio
Canal] which, for years, he has been laboring
with zeal and exertion to erect to his memory,
and which, no doubt, he had fondly hoped would
transmit his name down to the latest posterity,
must fall, and must give place to the superior
improvement of railroads."</p>

<p>On the proposed national road from Buffalo
to New Orleans by way of Washington the
opposition poured out its vials of sarcasm and
ridicule. To the arguments of the friends of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
the measure, that the road was needed as a
commercial and military avenue and for the use
of the Post-office department, the reply was a
denial so sweeping, from such reliable and informed
parties, that there was no hope for the
measure. Perhaps the strongest argument for
the negative was advanced by James K. Polk,
who was little less than withering in his fire,
piling up ridicule on top of sarcasm to a degree
seldom seen in Congress. Polk found that
twenty-one routes between Washington and
Buffalo had been outlined by engineers for this
road "in the rage for engineering, surveying,
reconnoitring, and electioneering." He alleged
that the entire population in a space of territory
one hundred miles in width between the two
cities had been made to expect the road, and the
surveys had been conducted in the heat of a
political campaign. "The certain effect of this
system, as exemplified by this road, is, first, to
excite hopes; second, to produce conflicts of
section arrayed against section; and lastly, dissatisfaction
and heart-burnings amongst all who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
are not accommodated." The speaker exhausted
his keen-edged sarcasm on the word "national"
and the uses to which the word was put by the
defenders of the improvement bills. He affirmed
that he was sure a number of men who proposed
to support the Buffalo-New Orleans Road Bill
would not consider it sufficiently "national" if
it were known that it was not to pass through
their districts; he affirmed that every catfish in
the Ohio River was a "national" catfish as truly
as the Cumberland Road was a national road;
he challenged the friends of the bill to decide
definitely upon a route for the proposed road
from the Lakes to the Gulf, and then hold true
to the measure representatives from districts
through which the road was not to pass. Polk
affirmed that the many various surveys were made
merely to ally with the friends of the measure
the representatives of all districts touched by
these alternative courses. "This same national
road was mounted as a political hobby in my district,"
said the Tennessean; "for a time the people
seemed to be carried away with the prospect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
of having millions of public money expended
among them. We were to have a main route and
cross routes intersecting the district in every
direction. It was to run down every creek, and
pass through almost every neighborhood in the
district. As soon as there was time for reason to
assume her seat the delusion passed off."</p>

<p>These points of opposition to the improvement
campaign have been outlined at some length to
show the strength of the opposition and the
ground it took. No measure went through Congress
for any kind of Government aid without
the strongest kind of opposition; in fact, the
Virginia delegates worked and voted against the
Dismal Swamp Canal in their own State in order
to be consistent with their oft-expressed views
on such questions. Yet, one by one, a considerable
number of important measures of internal
improvement went through Congress and received
the signatures of the different Presidents;
the effect of these measures was inestimably
beneficial, giving a marked impetus to national
development, and awakening in men's minds a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
dim conception of the growth that was to be the
one great wonder of the century.</p>

<p>From the adoption of the Constitution to the
year 1828 the following sums were granted by
the general Government for purposes either of
education or road-building or canal-building:
Maine, $9,500; New York, $4,156; Tennessee,
$254,000; Arkansas, $45,000; Michigan,
$45,000; Florida, $83,417; Ohio, $2,527,404;
Illinois, $1,725,959; Indiana, $1,513,161; Missouri,
$1,462,471; Mississippi, $600,667; Alabama,
$1,534,727; Louisiana, $1,166,361. In
addition to this the Government built, or assisted
in building, five great works of improvement
from among the scores that were proposed. For
the Delaware and Chesapeake Canal $300,000
was advanced; for the Chesapeake and Ohio
Canal, $10,000; for the Dismal Swamp Canal,
$150,000; for the Louisville and Portland
Canal, $90,000; for the Cumberland Road,
$2,230,903; for western and southwestern State
roads, $76,595, making a total appropriation of
$13,838,886.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span></p>

<p>The danger of the system was in making the
national purse an object of plunder for Congressmen,
and the consequent danger of unholy
alliances and combinations for looting the public
treasury. It is interesting that for so long a
period as it was in vogue there were so slight
symptoms of this sort of thing; and men little
knew that, by acting on liberal lines at the time,
despite the dangers and risks, they were exerting
a power to shape the new nation, to incite private
investment, to encourage State and private works
of promotion, and to aid the commercial awakening
of a people to an activity and an enterprise
whose possibilities cannot at the present day be
estimated. Take the Portland Canal around the
historic "falls of the Ohio" at Louisville; this
was a work for no one State in particular to perform,
not even Kentucky; it was a detriment to
Louisville itself, for it destroyed the old portage
business, as the Erie Canal ruined the overland
carrying trade between Schenectady and Albany.
All the States bordering on the Ohio were benefited
by this improvement, as was equally true
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
respecting the Government's improvement of
the Ohio River itself, which began in 1825. The
Portland Canal was one of the important investments
which tended to prove the financial benefit
of such investments. The Government's total
subscription of stock was $233,500; when the
affairs of the Company were closed in 1874 by
the purchase of the canal by the Government,
it was found that the national profit (in mere
interest) had been $257,778. This was due to
exorbitant tolls charged by the Company, which
resulted, finally, in the purchase of the canal and
throwing it open toll-free.</p>

<p>The men who labored for this era of improvement
are practically unknown, with the exception
of two or three who became prominent because of
special ability or renown gained in other lines
of activity, like Clay and Calhoun. It is not
important here to attempt to catalogue them;
the work they did by voting for the so-called
American System was of critical importance;
but, still greater, in so doing they were showing
a braver, more optimistic, more American spirit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
and a high faith in the fundamental good judgment
of the people. It was, without doubt, a
dangerous extreme to approach, possible of
wanton violation in unprincipled hands, and a
precedent of very questionable tendencies. But
it was of immeasurable importance that such
moral support as just such acts as these afforded
should have come at just this time; and, could
we read the result aright, it would be seen, possibly,
that much of our commercial success found
its origin at this very moment, and came into
being because a number of men at this crucial
time gave an impetus to private adventure
and private investment that was almost providential
in its ultimate effect on our national life.
Losing their individual identity in the common
promotion of temporary measures of infinite
national advantage, they will be remembered only
in a vague, impersonal way as men who honored
their country by trusting in its destiny and
believing in the genius of its growth.</p>

<p class="center p1">THE ROMANCE OF WOULD-BE
FOUNDERS OF EMPIRE IN THE
EARLY DAYS OF THE SOUTHWEST</p>

<p class="center">BY</p>

<p class="center">WILLIAM HORACE BROWN</p>

<p class="center p1"><i>Illustrated with portraits, and with original drawings
by W. J. Enright.   Price $1.50 net.</i></p>


<p class="p1">"Here is a history that reads like sheer romance. Mr. Brown tells
in a delightful way the story of those who dreamed dreams of empire
in the far West.... The book, typographically, is a fine sample of
McClurg work. It is profusely illustrated."&mdash;<i>Toledo Times Bee.</i></p>

<p>"It is a pleasure to assure the reader that one may have as much
fun reading 'The Glory Seekers' as William Horace Brown had
writing it. Few historical books are written in such sprightly vein,
and few informative books of any sort are so leavened with humor."&mdash;<i>St.
Louis Post Dispatch.</i></p>

<p>"When romance and history, adventure and fact, are combined in
readable style, and the history happens to be a field with which we
are not all familiar, but in which we are much interested, a book is
produced that will be irresistible to many.... Thrilling adventure is
plentiful in these pages, and it has the added interest of its political
significance. Written in a pleasant, familiar style, not without sharp
and illuminating comment, 'The Glory Seekers' is a book to be read
with keen delight by the student of history and the lover of romance."&mdash;<i>Des
Moines Mail and Times.</i></p>

<p>"A volume which will find an honorable place among Americana....
Mr. Brown's style is detailed and explicit. He indulges in keen
character delineation. He makes these hardy adventurers offer their
specious apologies. They cease to be the dim and menacing figures
of our national history and become comprehensible, if fatal, figures.
The book is one which fills a vacancy in history."&mdash;<i>Chicago Tribune.</i></p>

<p>"His effort has been rather to scrape off the successive coats of
whitewash which local historians have liberally applied to the darker
side of their deeds, and, while giving the would-be empire builders full
credit for their personal bravery and physical prowess, to show forth
their ambitions and exploits in their true colors."&mdash;<i>New York Tribune.</i></p>

<p>"A book that reads like a novel.... It is not a story to make
'every American's cheek flush with pride,' but, 'The Glory Seekers'
is a strong and vivid depiction of the true history of the Southwest,
colored with incident and anecdote, and suffused with the enthusiastic
Americanism which the most cynical attitude cannot hide."&mdash;<i>Butte
Inter Mountain.</i></p>

<p>"A unique, interesting, and valuable story of the early days of the
Southwest, when adventurous spirits tried at various times to establish
an empire there. Mr. Brown has made an exhaustive study of his
subject, and has the facts, which are presented with a cleverness of
narration that makes them most delightful reading."&mdash;<i>Pittsburg
Dispatch.</i></p>

<p>"Very unconventional in its style, lively and highly entertaining."&mdash;<i>The
Churchman.</i></p>

<p>"The author of this excellent and exceedingly interesting work has
made a thorough study of the various efforts to found local governments
in Texas, independent of Mexico, at an early day.... He is to
be congratulated for his excellent work in this historical summary of
events in that great region."&mdash;<i>Salt Lake Tribune.</i></p>

<p>"The work is well done. The narratives are lively and well told,
and while not highly important episodes, they are all worth preserving
as correctives to the too partial story of the colonial patriots as served
up in the usual United States histories, if for nothing else."&mdash;<i>New
York American.</i></p>

<p>"The romantic story of conquest is brilliantly told."&mdash;<i>Portland
Oregonian.</i></p>

<span class="font-smaller">AND OTHER ESSAYS IN WESTERN HISTORY</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>With maps and illustrations</i></p>

<p>The majority of the eight essays contained in the volume were first
delivered as lectures, and were later accorded magazine publication.
For the present publication they have been radically revised and
brought down to date, and comprise an exceptionally interesting collection
of papers covering a wide range of topics under the one general
head. The titles of the essays are as follows: "How George Rogers
Clark Won the Northwest," "The Division of the Northwest into
States," "The Black Hawk War," "The Story of the Mackinac,"
"The Story of La Pointe," "A Day on Braddock's Road," "Early
Lead Mining on the Upper Mississippi," "The Draper Manuscripts."</p>


<p class="center p1">ON THE STORIED OHIO</p>

<p class="center"><i>An Historical Pilgrimage of a Thousand Miles in a Skiff, from Redstone to Cairo.
With new Preface and full-page illustrations from photographs.</i></p>

<p>This trip was undertaken by Mr. Thwaites some years ago, with the
idea of gathering local color for his studies of Western history. The
Ohio River was an important factor in the development of the West.
The voyage is described with much charm and humor, and with a constant
realization of the historical traditions on every side. For the
better understanding of these references, the author has added a brief
sketch of the settlement of the Ohio Valley. A selected list of journals
of previous travellers has also been included.</p>


<p class="center p1">DOWN HISTORIC WATERWAYS</p>

<p class="center"><i>Six Hundred Miles of Canoeing upon Illinois and Wisconsin Rivers. Second Edition,
revised, with new Preface, and eight full-page illustrations from photographs.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Thwaites' book is not only a charming account of a summer
canoe trip, but an excellent guide for any one who is contemplating a
similar "inland voyage." The course followed by the canoeist is described
with a practical accuracy that makes it of great assistance, but
in an engaging style that will appeal strongly to every lover of outdoor
life. "It is a book to be read to get the spirit of the woods and
rivers and streams and lakes."&mdash;<i>Worcester Spy.</i></p>

<p class="txt-indent2">By <span class="smcap">Eva Emery Dye</span>. A Tale of Two Shores. Illustrations by
Walter J. Enright. 12mo, $1.50.</p>

<p>The chance casting away of a party of Japanese on the Oregon coast many years ago
inspired McDonald, a fully historical personage, to enact a similar drama in his own
proper self with the characters and continents reversed. Landing on the shores of
Japan he was passed from governor to governor until he reached the capital. There he
was permitted to establish a school, and it was actually his pupils who acted as interpreters
during the negotiations with Commodore Perry, generally supposed to be the first of
Americans to enter Japan. Mrs. Dye has long been aware of the facts in McDonald's
unusual career, having obtained them largely from his own lips; but she deferred publication
until his papers finally reposed in her hands. It will be remembered that the
hero of this new book entered largely into her story of "McLoughlin and Old Oregon,"
to which this later volume is in a sense a sequel.</p>

<i>Third Edition</i>, with frontispiece in full color by Charlotte Weber.
12mo, $1.50.</p>

<p>No book published in recent years has more of tremendous import between its
covers, and certainly no recent novel has in it more of the elements of a permanent
success. A historical romance which tells with accuracy and inspiring style of the
bravery of the pioneers in winning the western continent should have a lasting place in
the esteem of every American.</p>

this great nation can afford to pass by this book."&mdash;<i>Cleveland Leader.</i></p>

of Lewis and Clark, and of events following the occupation of Oregon."&mdash;<i>The

<p>"It may not be the great American novel we have been waiting for so long, but it
certainly looks as though it would be very near it."&mdash;<i>Rochester Times.</i></p>

United States; their story is a national epic."&mdash;<i>Detroit Free Press.</i></p>

<p class="txt-indent2">By <span class="smcap">Eva Emery Dye</span>. A Chronicle.
  <i>Fifth Edition.</i> 12mo, $1.50.</p>

<p>This is a most graphic and interesting chronicle of the movement which added to
the United States that vast territory, previously a British possession, of which Oregon
formed a part, and how Dr. John McLoughlin, then chief factor of the Hudson's Bay
Company for the Northwest, by his fatherly interest in the settlers, displeased the
Hudson's Bay Company and aided in bringing this about. The author has gathered her
facts at first hand, and as a result the work is vivid and picturesque and reads like a
romance.</p>

<p>"A spirited narrative of what life in the wilderness meant in the early days, a
record of heroism, self-sacrifice, and dogged persistence; a graphic page of the story of
the American pioneer."&mdash;<i>New York Mail and Express.</i></p>
